Here **Doctor Diwan Singh Ji**, famous historian **Baba Prem Singh Ji** and **Sardar Sant Singh Ji** of Garhi Kapura etc. Guru's beloveds had established a beautiful Satsang Mandal. Here he had been performing Kirtan for only a few days when a unique incident happened.

About 12 miles from **Hoti Mardan**, right on the border of non-settled (Ghair-Ilaka, tribal) area, a small village existed, whose name in Pashto was **'Sara Cheena'** (Cold Spring). A poor devout Sikh **Bhai Visakha Singh** lived here and about 9-10 households were of other faiths also.
Two of [his sons?] were killed by the bullets of Pathans of non-settled area. Bhai Visakha Singh...

[Bhai Sahib was asked to perform Anand Karaj there?]
