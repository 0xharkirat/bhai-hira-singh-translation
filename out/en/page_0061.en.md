## English (Meaning Translation)

...It is known that from laying the foundation stone till the completion of the building [Bhai Sahib] served the school day and night.

At the **6th Sikh Educational Conference** which was held in **Ambala** in **March 1913**, in its Pandal, Bhai Hira Singh Ji took a pledge that as long as **twenty thousand rupees** are not collected for the fixed fund of this school, till then...
In **Khalsa Samachar** of **30-9-1913**, Bhai Sahib clarified about this pledge and written that "My pledge is of **30 thousand** and not 20 thousand... because till this 20 thousand is collected, 10 thousand is also needed for running expenses..."
In this pledge, not only was it that he will not use the money received during Kirtan for his personal use, but also that until this pledge is fulfilled, whenever he would come to Faruka for some school work or committee meeting, he would not step into his own house, but would come and stay in a **Gufa** (Cave/Underground room) which he had earlier built for **Sant Attar Singh Ji** near the school outside.
To the extent that once when there was some trouble in the house, **Bhai Sham Singh Ji** called him by telegram but he did not enter the house.
This pledge was fulfilled after about **16 months** in **Kohat** and the Sangat of Kohat offered **2800 rupees** instead of the fixed 1800 rupees.
(Khalsa Advocate, 2 October 1926)

[Students] had started coming... and the issue of their residence became important. For this sake, near the school **thirty bighas** of land was purchased from Muslim landlords. For this much effort had to be made because according to **Land Alienation Act**, non-cultivator could not buy land of cultivator. To settle this matter Bhai Sahib had to [work hard/face difficulty]. Finally success was achieved and a plan of a large Boarding House was made in which buildings of magnificent Gurdwara, Hospital and Girls School [were included].
On this project large expense was to come and for this Bhai Hira Singh Ji started effort and after labor of three-four years in **1916**...

## Notes
- "Intkal Arazi Act" refers to the Punjab Land Alienation Act of 1900 which restricted sale of land from agricultural tribes to non-agricultural tribes. Bhai Sahib likely faced hurdles if he wasn't classified as an agriculturist "Jat".
