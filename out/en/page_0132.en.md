...[his contribution] is part of his earnings. At the time of building every Ashram, he contributed his month or two months' worth of earnings... From where did this power of practical 'Dan' (charity) in life come into a Ragi?... This was the glory of Naam, which Bhai Hira Singh earned, and along with it was the fruit of that true yearning which he kept within to make himself a Gursikh.
This is the lesson, this is the instruction which we Sikh travelers and virtues-seekers should take from Bhai Hira Singh Ji's life.
This is the secret of his success, this is the diamond particle (*Hira Kani*) of his life, which is shining in the Panth till now.

## Notes
- "ਹੀਰਾ ਕਣੀ" (Hira Kani): Diamond particle/gem. Also a play on his name "Hira".
