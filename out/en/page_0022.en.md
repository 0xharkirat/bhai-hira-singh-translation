## English (Meaning Translation)

**(1792-1888)**: [He was born] in 1879 with the blessings and prayer of the Mahant Sahib of the Shahpur Dera of the Seva Panthi sect. Regarding the birth of this child... it is written in 'Sant Gatha' of [Bhai] Vir Singh Ji...

One [day] Bhai Ram Kishan Ji, while touring with his Mandli (group), arrived at village Faruka, district Shahpur (now Sargodha). Next morning, the Kirtan of Asa Di Var was to be performed. Udasi Baba Karam Das, who knew Bhai Bhag Singh Ji Ragi of Faruka, was also there. He [asked] Bhai Bhag Singh Ji to perform Kirtan...

When [Adi Granth] was being closed... Bhai Bhag Singh Ji sat there with his head down. Baba Karam Das Ji asked from nearby why he was sitting. He said, "Maharaj Ji, it has been about 18 years since his marriage, but still no child has been born. Please be kind and give some infallible word so that his lineage may continue with the world."

Hearing this, **Sant Bhai Ram Kishan Ji** said in a color (mood) of ecstasy: "Doesn't he perform Kirtan of the Guru? The root of the Guru's Kirtaniya (singer) is always green. The Guru will fulfill your wish. A diamond (**Hira**) will be born in your house. Say 'Dhan Guru Nanak', 'Dhan Guru Nanak' and stay happy."
Then he said to Bhai Bhag Singh Ji's wife to recite Sukhmani Sahib daily. Saying this, he asked for a bowl of water... washed his feet's toe in the water... and ordered to drink the water.

It is the statement of Bhai Bhag Singh Ji that after 11 months of this boon of Bhai Ram Kishan Ji, Waheguru blessed a son in their house. Taking the son, they appeared at the Dera of Sant Bhai Ram Kishan Ji at Shahpur. The ceremony of Chola (initiation dress) and Naming was done here. Bhai Ram Kishan Ji named this boy **'Hira Singh'** with his own holy tongue.
This very boy grew up to become **Bhai Hira Singh Ji**, the 'Amolak Hira' (Precious Diamond) of Khalsa Panth and a devoted Sikh of the Guru's house, true to his word and brave in deeds... unsurpassed Kirtaniya that with his Kirtan power he brought staunchest atheists to the Guru's shelter, created love for Sikhism in the hearts of many Arya Samajis, made Muslims say 'Dhan Guru Nanak' and swayed gatherings of 25-30 thousand people in divine color.

After Bhai Hira Singh Ji, two more sons were born in the house of Bhai Bhag Singh Ji - **Bhai Gurmukh Singh Ji** (1882-1957) and **Bhai Pradhan Singh Ji** (1895-1959).
Mata Sat Bharai Ji was of a very cool temperament and lover of Naam Bani... She used to serve food and water to visitors in the Dharamsala with great love and devotion...
