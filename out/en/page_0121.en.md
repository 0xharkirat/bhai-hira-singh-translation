If there was no dispute, the Nagar Kirtan concluded without any obstacles.
When the wave of apostasy spread, Muslims also started preaching (Tabligh), and Sikh organizations also began Sikh preaching and Amrit Parchar (initiation ceremonies). In these days, Bhai Hira Singh Ji Ragi came to Shimla. He was performing the Kirtan of Asa Di Var at ambrosial hours (Amrit Vela). Congregations were gathering. During the Kirtan explanation (Viakhya), Bhai Sahib said, "Khalsa Ji! Sikh preaching is taking place, it is a matter of great joy. You want, and I also want, that more and more people should come under the banner of Guru Gobind Singh. But, O beloveds of the Guru, O rubies of the Guru, have you ever looked inside [to see] if we are truly Guru's Sikhs?..."

There was such *ras* (emotion/sweetness) in his tongue and Kirtan that many gentlemen who did not even understand Punjabi—leaving aside understanding Gurbani—would come just to listen to the Kirtan.

One of my friends was a Madrasi. I asked him, "Do you understand this?"
He replied, *[English text in source]* "No, I do not understand what they sing or say, but I find their voice alone so loving because their voice itself is music."

This was the *ras*—the *Raag Ras*—in Bhai Sahib's tongue and speech.
