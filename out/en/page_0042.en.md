## English (Meaning Translation)

**Sardar Sundar Singh Ji Majithia** writes in one of his articles:
"...Bhai Hira Singh Ji reached exactly at 5 o'clock. He had brought [ragis?] from the town. As soon as he came, he started Kirtan. He prayed to Kalgidhar Father, 'May some Sehajdhari have the glimpse [of becoming a Singh].'
In great love and emotion, he raised a call... 'Who will sit in the lap of Kalgidhar Father and becoming a Singh, become the beloved of the Guru?'
...At once he called out that the servant's uncle **Bhai Asa Nand Ji** should get up...
[He took Amrit and] was named **Asa Singh**. His family is blooming under Guru's grace. His son **Sardar Jaswant Singh** wakes up at Amrit Vela and performs Kirtan at home daily. The family is a beetle (follower) of Guru's feet."

Further Sardar Sundar Singh Ji writes, "When Bhai Sahib used to be in **Mardan**, Das (I) got the opportunity to be near him many times. Whenever seen, he used to be reciting Gurbani. Das (I) also took Amrit from Bhai Sahib." (Khalsa Samachar, 28-8-1952)

In the 'Bar' (Canal colony area) of **Sargodha**, there were many 'Chakks' (villages) of Sikhs where Sikh army-men were settled after pension. The population of **Chakk 64** was hardly 50-60 households, but with the effort of Guru-beloved **Bhai Prem Singh Ji**, 4-5 religious Diwans were held here with great pomp in which Sikhs from all Chakks of the Bar used to attend and take benefit.

It is a matter of year **1913-14** that near **Sillanwali** (District Sargodha) in this Chakk 64...
[Bhai Sahib] narrated that Sakhi in which the martyrdom of **Bhai Maha Singh** is mentioned...
Upon the separation of that soul, keeping his head in the lap of the Plume-Wearer...
When deep dispassion arose, tears flowed from the eyes of Sangats, Bhai Sahib himself was also [in tears]. When money started raining after the end of the [Diwan?], Bhai [Sahib] stood up and spreading his Jholi requested, 'Sadh Sangat Ji! Keep the money... [I want heads/commitment]'
