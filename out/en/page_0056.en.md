## English (Meaning Translation)

**17th Conference which was held in May 1926 in Lahore**, was the last [conference] for Bhai Hira Singh Ji. At that time **Dr. Hira Singh Ji** was under treatment in **Kasur** hospital and could not be present physically. But he sent a written message through his younger brother **Bhai Pardhan Singh Ji** to Lahore, instructing him to read this last message of his in the Conference.

(The bird flies to foreign lands; by Grace, it bears good fruit.)

**Giani Sant Singh Kamalia**, who had read out this message, describing the glory of Kirtan in Guru's house, in very learned and loving words, expressed the virtue of accompanying those attached to Guru Nanak's hem and said: "Bhai Mardana was extremely dear to Guru Nanak Dev Ji.

**700 Sikhs** gave five hundred rupees each for this Conference and became Life Fellows...
