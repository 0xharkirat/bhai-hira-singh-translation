## English (Meaning Translation)

...[The Patwari said], "Baba! [By God] No! Allah has sent you as some angel. Your Kalam (speech/Kirtan) has melted me... Blessed is the mother who gave birth to you."
...Upon the settlement of Land matter, a wave of happiness ran through the Sangats.
Congratulations were received by Bhai Sahib from all sides. On the other side, **S. Sundar Singh [Majithia]**, **Bhai Sahib Bhai Arjan Singh Ji Bagrian** also reached. Since the Diwan place was near the road, ... Sangat ran and met them ahead and Sardar Sahib reached the Diwan place with the Sangat, where he was requested to perform the service of Jathedar (preside over), but Sriman Ji (Sardar Majithia) in humble words stated the purpose of his coming for ten minutes and sat in the Tabya (attendance) of Guru Granth Sahib Ji. The entire Hindu-Muslim Sangat was feeling blissful seeing the holy saintly nature of Sriman Ji.

After that, performing Ardas, the **Foundation Stone** was laid by **Singh Sahib Jathedar S. Sundar Singh Ji Majithia** with his lucky hands.

Among the poems read at that time, the following poems by **Kavi Santokh Singh**...:
[Poem roughly translates to praising the event, the foundation stone laying, and the glory of the school]
"...A school inside which beautiful education will be given, where Sikh children will study..."

## Notes
- "Tabya" refers to the position behind Guru Granth Sahib Ji, waving the Chaur Sahib.
