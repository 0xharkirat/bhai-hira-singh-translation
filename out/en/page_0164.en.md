*"Je gun hovan sajna mil sajh karijai"*
(If there are virtues, O friends, let us meet and share them)

**Sriman Bhai Sahib Bhai Vir Singh Ji,**
*Main Article, Khalsa Samachar 30.8.1951*

This Guru-Word is a teaching lesson for the guidance of every Sikh. Bhai Hira Singh has gone, but the memory is still alive. Even though the Sikh Panth, which he served incessantly, did not establish any memorial for him, yet the imprints remain on the papers of hearts.
His body became peaceful (passed away) in Dehradun on 2 September 1926 AD.
During [his] final days, he received the service, love, and holy company of Dr. Balbir Singh Ji, and the final cremation also took place under his supervision. After 25 years, his memory is alive today among the Satsangis of that time in Dehradun.
Bhai Hira Singh lived a beautiful life and made his birth successful. Almost his entire life was spent doing Kirtan. The respect he received in the congregations during his time was so great and deep that it was unique. Young Gursikhs [learned] from his life...
That was the key to his success and the power that made his life successful.
It was this: That he was not just a rote memorizer of Gurbani quotes, nor someone who would match them with mental power in a clever way, nor was he just the master of a beautiful throat or a skilled master of the technique of music; despite having all this, the secret of his success and achievement lay in the fact that he was a 'Sikh of the Guru', in the true sense of these words!
He had a yearning inside him that "The Kirtan I do, the Bani that speaks to me and I recite to the congregations, that should become my practical life."
He used to tell [people]... that "At this time, my mind, merging with the tune of the Shabad and the [flow of] emotion, will go towards Waheguru and only Waheguru's Feet."
This sincere effort of Bhai Hira Singh Ji, this (*Emotional*) hearetfelt feeling, this earnest pleading... was that thing which is rare. This is what made his worth precious like the ruby of Salis Rai.
This is why in almost all the High Schools that were built, his earning (contribution) is there...
