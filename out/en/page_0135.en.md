# Bhai Pradhan Singh Ji Ragi

Younger than Bhai Hira Singh Ji, he had two brothers. One was Bhai Gurmukh Singh (1802[?] - 1957) who was a Punjabi and Religious Master at Chiefs College Lahore, and the second was Bhai Pradhan Singh Ji. Bhai Pradhan Singh Ji was born in 1895 shortly after Firuka [was settled?]. He used to sing Shabads since childhood, his throat (voice) was melodious. In 1903 at Nankana Sahib, on the occasion of Gurpurb, he recited a Shabad in the Pandall of Chief Khalsa Diwan. He received eight rupees as a prize, which he donated to the collection being made for Khalsa College that very day.

After passing Matric from Khalsa High School Firuka in 1916, he engaged in business. In 1926, when Bhai Hira Singh Ji was in Kasur Hospital, Bhai Pradhan Singh Ji used to work there in the firm of Sardar Harnam Singh 'Aate Wale' (Flour Merchant). Due to Bhai Sahib's illness, he had to leave his business... [he] would make Bhai Sahib listen to the Kirtan of one or two Shabads, which would soothe Bhai Sahib's soul.

After Bhai Hira Singh Ji's passing, his business had slowed down due to long absence. In 1928, he once went to Sri Amritsar to have Darshan of Bhai Sahib Bhai Vir Singh Ji. Bapu Ji and Das (the author) were also with him. Sri Bhai Sahib Ji gave much love. After asking about welfare/health and other conversation, Sri Bhai Sahib Ji asked Bhai Pradhan Singh Ji to recite a Shabad. He recited this Shabad:

> *Tum date thakur pratipalak naik khasam hamare ||*
> *Nimakh nimakh tum hi pratipalahu ham barik tumre dhare ||*
> (SGGS Ang 672) [Corrected to 673/674 usually?]

...He recited this Shabad so melodiously that Sri Bhai Sahib Ji's eyes closed and... tears flowed. A few minutes after the Shabad ended, when he opened his eyes, he... exclaimed "Wah". Giving a pat (blessing) to Bhai Pradhan Singh, he ordered, "Form a Jatha." Bapu Ji looked at Bapu Ji [?] and said, "You form a Jatha with him."
[Bapu Ji] requested, "My body is now very old, and with [the grief of] Bhai Hira Singh..."
