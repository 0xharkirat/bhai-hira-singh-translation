**A Glance at the Whole Life:**
Born due to the blessings of Sri Sant Bhai Ram Kishan Ji, the child Hira Singh, acquiring the humble nature and noble qualities of his saintly mother... grows up playing and studying in the lap of Baba Jiwan Singh. Then, acquiring the education of Gurbani and Gur-History from the scholar of [Faruka?], Bhai Mahna Singh Ji, and inheriting music from his father, in his youth, he falls at the door of Sri [Satguru?] Ram Das Ji. Along with Simran, he receives the holy company of Sri Sant [Attar?] Singh Ji, and the color of Naam ascends.
The influence of [Sant Attar Singh Ji's?] personality and development [shapes him].
And then he obtains the Satsang of Bhai Sahib Bhai Vir Singh Ji, which acts like **Suhega** (Borax) on gold [purifying/bonding it]. Making the supremely holy service of the Guru Panth his goal from here, Bhai Hira Singh, moving about in a pure form, serving this world for 46-47 years, leaving behind a beautiful fragrance, departs from us.
In his life... Bhai Hira Singh Ji cooled many burning hearts through Naam Bani and [gave?] solace to those souls...
Along with this, he participated in Panthic works, educational and social reform fields...
Upon his passing, these words from the main article of *Khalsa Samachar* dated [Sept?] 9, 1926:
...in his passing today...
