## English (Meaning Translation)

'...If the Plume-Wearer Satguru is dear [to you], then get ready to take Amrit... And O Sehajdhari brothers! Guru sacrificed himself [for you], become Amritdhari Singhs, keep Guru['s form] and enjoy the Sikh faith.'
Hearing his words, many Sehajdharis presented themselves to take Amrit. It is especially important to mention two of them.

One gentleman **Bhai Ladha Ram Dhamija** used to run a shop in **Chakk No. 126**. His wife's name was **Ram Bai**. There was no Keshadhari Sikh in their family... Bhai Ladha Ram stood up and asked for the gift of Amrit and became Singh along with his family. Then his name was kept **Ladha Singh** and sons' names **Ram Singh** and **Harnam Singh**.

When this family returned home after becoming Singhs, Bhai Ladha Singh's elder brother **Bhai Kaura Ram** got very angry and said, "You didn't even ask us... went and made the Ardas (commitment) yourself; you separate from us and don't show your face to us." In earlier times, there used to be much fear of elder brothers and they were respected like fathers. So Bhai Ladha Singh Ji got scared and remained silent for some time. But he meditated on Satguru Kalgidhar and prayed in his heart, "O Satguru! You yourself be kind." After a short while, he said to the elder brother with respect, "We have done a good deed from our side, but do you want that we should return the Ardas (break the vow)?"

Hearing the words "Return the Ardas?", Bhai Kaura Ram was stunned and got terrified; saying, "No, No. Ardas performed in Guru's presence cannot be returned. I made a mistake, pray for me, ask forgiveness for my mistake!"

After some time when the marriage of Bhai Ladha Singh's daughter was fixed, a dispute arose in the house. The brother of Bhai Ladha Singh's wife Ram Bai was of staunch Sanatan views. He said that if the marriage is done according to Gurmat (Anand Karaj), then the maternal family (Nanke) will not sit [in the ceremony]. But Bibi Ram Bai said, "We are not to turn away from the Guru, the promise we made to Bhai Hira Singh Ji in Guru's presence, we have to fulfill that. So whether brothers sit in the marriage or not, the marriage will be according to Gurmat only."

Then Ram Bai brought... brother... who came to explain... "Jajmani! This is the first marriage in your house, do not do this wrong work... lest some trouble befalls your family." Bhai Ladha Singh and Bibi Ram Bai remained firm...
Finally, the Anand Karaj was performed according to Gur-Maryada and everyone...
Bhai Hira Singh Ji was not just a Ragi, but a purely devoted... filled with emotions of faith...
With the intoxication of Naam-Khumari his beautiful eyes remained intoxicated...
