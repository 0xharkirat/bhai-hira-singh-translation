## English (Meaning Translation)

...opportunity I got, where reading the details of Bhai Hira Singh Ji's life and his services to Conferences and Sikh Ashrams published in the Educational Committee's 'Silver Jubilee Book' (1935) and 'Golden Jubilee Book' (1958), my eyes were opened. I felt astonished joy, and my enthusiasm increased further.

Upon the loss of the material written in Bhai Hira Singh Ji's own hand, I observed that the events of Bhai Sahib's preaching field are found mostly in 'Khalsa Samachar'. His relations with this weekly remained deep from its inception till the end. Since November 1899, when this paper started, details regarding Bhai Hira Singh Ji's selfless service for Amrit Sanchar (Sikh baptism) and Gur-Maryada Anand Karaj (Sikh wedding ceremony) are found in it.

I examined some old files of Khalsa Samachar at 60 Lawrence Road, Amritsar, and [others] by going to Sahit Kendra Dehradun.

Here, when I read the three articles published in the September month of the 1926 Khalsa Samachar file upon Bhai Sahib's passing (which were published in the issues of 9, 23, and 30 September 1926), I burst into tears and realized: "What! He was such a great personality and we didn't even know this much!"

"I opened the treasure of my father and grandfather,
And I found the storehouse of jewels."
(G.G.S. Ang 186)

This Guru-Vak (Guru's word) became visibly true.

The photo of late Giani Hira Singh Dard with Bhai Sahib was obtained from the old issues of 'Phulwari' from Jalandhar after a long search.
I read the 'Khalsa' newspapers of the last decades of the previous century by going to the Bhai Ditt Singh Library in Ferozepur.

As far as my personal knowledge is concerned, I submit that at the time of Bhai Sahib's passing, my age was 15 years. Although he got very little time to stay at home, he used to take us children along to many Diwans and Conference congregations. Therefore, looking at his life from childhood... his life according to Gurmat, starting every task by taking the shelter of Guru Maharaj and offering Ardas... not crying or wailing at home upon the death of his daughter (1922)...
