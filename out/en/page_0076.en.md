## English (Meaning Translation)

[Context: Bhai Hira Singh Ji's Kirtan effect continues]
...One [Lala Ram Ji?] got up and requested that "Please make me a Keshadhari Singh."
[Many] Karahs were prepared. The influence was such that [every day] some seeker would get up and express desire for Sikhi. Some Singhs [who took Amrit/Kesh?]... **Lala Ram Labhaya Mal Ji**, **Lala Ganesh Das Ji**, **Diwan Mul Chand Sindhi**, **Master Vir Bhan Ji** etc.

Since Bhai Sahib had dedicated [himself/everything?] to the Diwan, whatever money was received as Shabad-Bheta, was all deposited for the Preaching Fund of **Chief Khalsa Diwan** through **S. Chet Singh Saudagar (Merchant) Iran**.
Quetta dwelling Sikh Sangat is extremely thankful to Chief Khalsa Diwan who sent the Shiromani Jatha of Panth and got such unique preaching done in Quetta.

Bhai Sahib's last Diwan was on **24.8.1920**. It was full of amazing Vairag (dispassion) and Karuna Ras (Pathos). The scene at the station at the time of departure was worth seeing.
Bhai Hira Singh Ji felt the praise received in Quetta as a burden on his soul and considered it harmful for his spiritual life. So when he reached back **Amritsar Ji** (where he was residing those days), getting off the train... he sent the Jatha straight home to **Chowk Karori** and himself reached **Sri Harmandir Sahib**. Doing service of dusting shoes (Jora-Ghar) with his own hands, he bathed his consciousness (Surat) and offered all this praise and honor at the holy feet of **Sri Guru Ram Das Ji** and performed Ardas:
*"Guru Nanak Sabh Teri Wudiyayi, Koi Nao Na Janai Mera"*
(Guru Nanak, all this glory is Yours, no one knows my name.)
(Guru Granth Sahib, Ang 383)

And in this way feeling himself light, he came home.

## Notes
- "Chowk Karori" is a locality in Amritsar.
- "Vairag" refers to spiritual detachment/longing.
