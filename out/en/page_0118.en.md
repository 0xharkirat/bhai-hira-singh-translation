## English (Meaning Translation)

[S. Hardit Singh Malik Continued...]
...Actually I had gone there at that time as a part of government staff.
There was immense mass of people, approximately **One Lakh** people were gathered. On the building of Gurdwara, outer porches and nearby roofs, a sea of Sangat was looking. In that countless crowd, innumerable women and children were present... the Diwan had become like a fair. Sangat was spread in such a large circle that it was impossible for us to control it.
Ragis were sitting in presence of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji. When Kirtan started, noise was so much that we who were quite near the Parkash Asthan, could not hear anything. Remember, in those days there were no **Loudspeakers**. We tried for some time to control that noise and din but considering it a futile effort, we sat down defeated.

At that time Bhai Hira Singh Ji came on stage. In his sweet and polite voice, he begged for gift of silence. First of all he asked people sitting near him to be silent and when this happened, he tried to increase the circle of peace. Within some time the whole gathering came under his attraction and went silent.
Such peace happened that if someone dropped even a needle, its sound could be heard. [For hours] people enjoyed the Juice (Ras) of Divine Kirtan and that whole gathering rose up intoxicated like mast elephants singing praises of Bhai Sahib's Raag.
After that evening I have done Government Service for whole life... but such charisma... I never saw again.

**Letter of Doctor Karam Chand Ji:**
I was preparing to send this biography to press for printing when I received a letter dated **6 August 1980** from **Dr. Karam Chand Ji** of **Delhi** (Doctor Sahib is serving common people from unrecognized abode). In which he has sent two-three eyewitness incidents about effect of Bhai Sahib's speech.
"Bhai Hira Singh Ji was a very high and pure personality. He was not just a Ragi, but a true pure Sikh as described in Gurbani... He was of saintly nature... his voice was Raag itself... it used to put life in dead hearts and make friends out of enemies.
...In **1922-23** there were great **Hindu-Muslim riots** in **Delhi**. In those days on occasion of a Gurpurb, a **Nagar Kirtan** was to be taken out by Sikhs..."
