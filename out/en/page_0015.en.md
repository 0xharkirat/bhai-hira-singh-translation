## English (Meaning Translation)

...Faruka, Bhai Hira Singh Ji's [town].
As far as religious life is concerned, this was due to the labor and service-simran of the great men of the Seva Panthi Deras of West Punjab.
In the area of Jhang, there were many Deras of this sect, such as Shahpur, Mitha Tiwana, Nurpur Thal, Shah Jiwana, Jhang Maghiana, Kot Isa Shah and Lallu etc.
Due to the high and pure living and earning of Naam by their Saints and Mahants, [the spread of] Sikhism used to happen naturally.

In Faruka also, there was an abode of 'Bhai Jeet Singh', blessed by this sect. Bhai Jeet Singh Ji, where he was a treasure of service and Simran, was also a great scholar. He started the system of Gurmukhi-Gurbani education in his Dharamsala... and similarly by establishing Dharamsalas in nearby villages, he spread Sikhism and established centers of Gurmukhi-Gurbani education. In these Dharamsalas, the visiting travelers also received food, water, and rest. Then bringing congregations from far and wide to Faruka, Bhai Jeet Singh Ji used to hold Satsang and flow the stream of Katha-Kirtan.

Bhai Jeet Singh Ji is written as a supremely generous soul, celibate, and contented person. The awe of his saintliness was so established in the whole area that Hindus and Muslims alike respected him. Bhai Jeet Singh Ji's successor was Bhai Darbara Singh Ji. Ahead were Bhai Ganda Singh and then Bhai Jiwan Singh Ji. Their departure... happened in 1942 after living the age of [number] years.

The second disciple of Bhai Ganda Singh of the aforementioned lineage was **Bhai Mahna Singh Ji**. He built a separate abode by taking an open space in front of the aforementioned Dharamsala. Here, Langar was always ready and every call of the visitors was served. Bhai Mahna Singh Ji was very benevolent. He used to help the poor and widows/needy a lot.
The grain for [his] Langar was ground on hand-mills in houses...
Bhai Mahna Singh Ji was a very learned and virtuous man. In his Dharamsala, the Katha of... Suraj Prakash continued constantly. All Sikhs [received] Gurmukhi education [from him].
