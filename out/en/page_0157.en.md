*Khalsa Samachar*

Ah! The Beautiful Priceless Diamond of the Panth...
...
...
Offering my mind with joined hands, I pray to Guru Ji...
Grant residence in Vaikunth (Heaven) and Inder Puri...
Grant light in skies, Guru Ji...
Beautiful necklace of beads...

- S. Amir Singh Nur, Second Year Student,
Khalsa High School, Sri Ganganagar
(He was an old student. He recited this poem in Faruka on the day of Bhai Sahib's Bhog, September [15], 1926).

...Black clouds have climbed...
...Fear of famine in the country...
...
(Fragmented poem lines about loss and sorrow)

## Notes
