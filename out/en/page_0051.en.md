## English (Meaning Translation)

...[The other party] was not ready... and he wanted to perform Lavan with Bedis (around fire?), while for this the boy's father was not ready. The situation reached a point of dispute and Sardar Ji brought the Barat back. Upon this **Sardar Ram Singh General Merchant** accepted with great pleasure to perform the Anand of his daughter with that Sardar's son right then.
...It was considered necessary to celebrate [this event]. For this **Bhai Bhag Singh Hira Singh Ji** were called by telegram and for three days full Diwans were held on the occasion of the wedding.

An interesting incident of an Anand Karaj was narrated to us in **August 1967** by Gurmukh Pyare **Sardar Gurmukh Singh Ji**, Retired Engineer. He was a Satsangi gentleman of very high life and spiritual enjoyment. After living an age of about **95 years**, he left for Guru's feet on **4 September 1968**. He narrated the story of the marriage of his elder son **Sardar Kulwant Singh Ji**, which took place in **1914** in **Jammu** with the daughter of **Colonel Anant Ram**.
Both gentlemen were on high posts in the State and Colonel Sahib hesitated from Maharaja Sahib because he (Maharaja) did not like marriages to happen by any other custom than Bedis (Hindu ritual) in his state.
On this side **S. Gurmukh Singh Ji** was a follower of Singh Sabha objectives and also he had called Bhai Hira Singh Ji for this task. He kept trying to convince Colonel Sahib till late night but he did not agree for Anand Karaj in any way.

When **Bhai Hira Singh Ji** came to know about this... he also came there and started talking to Colonel Sahib. Meanwhile, a Pandit came and said, "Sir, the time for Mahurat has passed."
On this Bhai Hira Singh Ji [seized the opportunity] and said, "Your Mahurat time has passed, but our Mahurat (Amrit Vela) is yet to come."
So... Prakash was done... Bhai Bhag Singh Hira Singh Ji bound the essence of Kirtan...
When the Anand Karaj was performed according to Gurmat, [seeing the glory] Maharaja... was very pleased...

## Notes
