## English (Meaning Translation)

...are martyred in the battle of Bhangani and this man of God, **Sayyad [Budhu Shah]** considers himself blessed.
In Chamkaur, **Nabi Khan** and **Ghani Khan** made Sri Guru Ji sit on a cot, lifted him on their heads and gave the call, "Uch Da Pir Hai" (Here is the Pir of Uch).
With these incidents, what is the surprise in this meeting?'
(Khalsa Samachar, 12-4-1917)

From the first Conference held in **Gujranwala in 1908** till 17th... in 1926...
In the great successes [of Sikh Educational Conferences], Bhai Hira Singh Ji kept dedicating his selfless service to the Panth.
At the time of First Conference, the impact of his dedication on the Panth leaders was such that the service of **Asa Di Var Kirtan** on the first day of religious Diwan was entrusted to Bhai Hira Singh Ji, and then he was also chosen to offer the **Ardas** (prayer) for the successful completion of this conference in the Pandal.
He performed this Ardas in such impressive and heart-touching words that **'The Tribune'** newspaper made a special mention of it in its issue of **23.4.1908** and wrote:
"[English quote about the impressive prayer...]"

Some original words of this Ardas, which have been obtained from **Khalsa Youngmen's Magazine, May 1908, page 208**, are as follows:
"First of all... [thanksgiving for seva]...
...that came to your share and... this service with ability...
power to do...
In the appeal for funds... hearts [were melted]... stone hearts turned to wax...
Words used to... [pierce] the depths of heart...
rupees used to jump out from pockets...
For example..."

## Notes
- "Pir of Uch" refers to the disguise Guru Gobind Singh Ji took to escape Machhiwara.
