...In [Bhai] Hira Singh Ji... [there was pain/longing?]...
...yearning for preaching, essence of Truth, his own pure deeds...
...no doubt or superstition, and to him his own Dharma seemed the greatest of all. In the light of these... he walked away, didn't tire, didn't give up... from the mistakes of the rulers...
...didn't stop. Whether someone called him good or bad, he [continued] praising his Master...
Complete in speech, patience, and living, Bhai Hira Singh Ji's mind, having been scrubbed by the Naam-like heart-purifier, had become such a priceless diamond that no [file?] or blow...
...could pass through it. Sorrow that Time has snatched that Kohinoor diamond from the treasury of the Panth...
...result of which is that the Panth is becoming lusterless without that Divine shine. The [servants?] of Guru's House...
...are looking impatient to hear those sweet lullabies that make one get lost in memory [of God].
