[Poem contd.] "...Guru Himself will show Grace..."
...Only two-three rooms were ready when classes were shifted there.
It got affiliated [to University?]. In **January 1911**, recognition was received from Education Department and in **1921** High [School] classes started and in **1924** the first batch was sent for Matriculation examination, of which all students passed.

**Manager Bhai Sham Singh:**
Bhai Sham Singh Ji was earlier a Patwari in **Jhawarian**. Around **1903**, he met Bhai Hira Singh Ji and when preparations for Faruka School started, he came into the selection of Bhai Hira Singh Ji's companions. Upon formation of School Committee, being an educated gentleman, he was appointed Manager of the school and he performed this service with ability throughout his life. He was a sorted, farsighted and wise person. His face was like a Jathedar (leader) and he was a good administrator. He had great tolerance and despite criticism used to work with a cool heart.
His brother **Bhai Harsa Singh Ji**, who earlier used to practice Hikmat (medicine) in Faruka and then became famous in Lyallpur, handed over his work to his sons (**Bhai Nidhan Singh, Jagat Singh**) and stayed in Faruka for 6-7 months to teach Bhai Sham Singh the work of [Hikmat/Management?]. So his work also started running and school work also started running [smoothly?]. He passed away in **1946** after living an age of 80 years.

**Facing Financial Crisis:**
To start the school was easy but [to run it was difficult]...
[Funds] were needed... not being able to bear expenses... money had to be collected from outside...
