## English (Meaning Translation)

...Singhs were martyred and many injured. Second Martyrdom Jatha departed on 28 February and reached Jaito on **14 March**, which was imprisoned. In this way total **17 Jathas** departed for martyrdom. Finally on **21 July 1925**, with the start of Akhand Paths at Gurdwara Gangsar Jaito, the restriction was removed and thus the Morcha ended.

For the **Jaito Morcha**, **Bhai Hira Singh Ji** dedicated his service to the Shiromani Committee and performed Kirtan service at Sri Akal Takht for the departing Jathas. In these Kirtans, Bhai Sahib filled such spirit of Sikh Sidak (faith) that the Jathas which came prepared for martyrdom, would get ready for any sacrifice with smiling faces.
...dedicated to the service of Committee.

An eye-witness account of this time given in writing by **Bhai Teja Singh Kohli** is being given here, which was published in **February 1973** issue of **'Gurmat Parkash'**:
"English Government did not hesitate to riddle the first Jatha of 500 Sikhs with bullets. Government was happy. People also used to say that hardly any second Jatha of 500 will be ready to go to the Morcha of Sri Gangsar.
But Hukamnamas had been issued from Sri Akal Takht Sahib, Sri Amritsar to Sikhs of **Peshawar, Pothohar, U.P., C.P., Bombay, Madras** and **Calcutta** and respecting the Hukamnamas, Guru's Sikhs were immediately reaching Sri Amritsar Ji.
To address the Shahidi Jatha, **Bhai Hira Singh Ji Ragi** came. There was no place even to throw a sesame seed in front of Akal Takht. Bhai Sahib's Kirtan and explanation was mesmerizing the Sangats...
It was very impressive. Leaders proposed that the Jatha of 500 prepared [should be inspected?].
...was sitting right next to him. When Bhai Sahib came on stage he saw that Sikh youth were standing, on whose faces youthfulness was overflowing. Fearless, carefree and full of enthusiasm and zeal, Tyar-Bar-Tyar, they were eager to pick up Panth's order. Seeing this, he became absolutely silent for a while and when his love and juice filled tongue opened, he said -
'O Image of my Kalgidhar Ji! My worshipable Guru Khalsa Ji! My heart wants to kiss your feet, apply dust of your feet to my forehead. I [bow] to your high active principle of Sikhism standing right here...'"
