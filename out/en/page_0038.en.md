## English (Meaning Translation)

Know that [the reasons/evils] for the fulfillment of whose objectives our elders did hard labor...
To remove the [ill-practices] Singh Sabha servants made such efforts...
Those have again entered among us today...
...rituals are performed according to [Gurmariada? or opposite?]. Leaving aside administering Amrit to boys and girls, sometimes it is not even mentioned. Garlands/Sehras around neck in presence of Guru Maharaj, photographers hopping here and there and many other kinds of... which were never even seen in those days.
Birth and death [ceremonies] are also not performed according to full Guru's tradition now. Picking bones (Phul) and taking them to Haridwar, which were declared against Gurmat, now even big honorable Sants are taken to Kiratpur etc. places which is not according to Gurmat.
Many other such evil practices have entered our society, to remove which and to revive the constructive forces, there is as much need now as there was at the time of Singh Sabha movement.

On the next few pages, an attempt has been made to give samples of the struggle done by Bhai Hira Singh Ji in this regard.

## Notes
- "Phul Chun-ne" refers to collecting ashes/bones after cremation.
- "Sehra" is the wedding garland/veil tied on groom's forehead.
