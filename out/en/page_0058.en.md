## English (Meaning Translation)

When efforts for educational progress started in the Panth and Khalsa Schools or Colleges started opening... then Bhai Hira Singh Ji offered his services for every institution and collected money and presented it. In this regard **Bhai Sahib Bhai Vir Singh Ji** wrote in **Khalsa Samachar** of **30 August 1951**, "...Almost every High School that was built has a share of his earnings. At the time of building of every Ashram (institution), he used to perform Ardas of his one or two months' income and give all offerings received during that time to that Ashram. **Faruka School** was almost entirely the fruit of that enthusiastic lover's labor. We know personally that for years he contributed to the success of this Ashram from his hard-earned income...
He was among the old and founding servants of **Central Khalsa Orphanage Amritsar**, **Khalsa College Amritsar** and **Orphanage Gharjakh (Gujranwala)**.

At **11th Sikh Educational Conference** at **Gujranwala**, for **Sri Guru Nanak Khalsa College**, in **1919**, he appealed for **forty thousand rupees** in very simple but heart-attracting sentences, because 12th class could only open there if this amount was collected. And on this appeal, **30-35 thousand cash** and **eight thousand rupees** as pledges were collected within minutes. Besides offering all the money that came on the harmonium (Vaja), Bhai Sahib also dedicated his one month's service to the college. This was just a sample of the effect of his appeal.

In appreciation of his services rendered in the educational field in **1915**, a certificate was sent to him by **[Lt. Governor of Punjab?]**, some words of which were as follows:
*"...I have heard much of you, that you have... shown great worth in the cause of education, this Sanad (Certificate) is given to you in recognition of your value."*

**Khalsa High School Faruka:** Since the school of Faruka came into existence purely by his personal effort and financial sacrifice, it is necessary to describe it specially.
This school is one of those few Khalsa schools...

## Notes
- "Vaja" refers to Harmonium.
