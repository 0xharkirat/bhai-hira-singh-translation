Just then, upon the start of summer holidays, Das (the author) reached Sri Amritsar along with a Master of Firuka School and met his father, Bhai Hira Singh Ji, at Wazir Hind Press, where he was working.
[From there we] went to Shimla and stayed in a room in a gentleman's Kothi (bungalow) in Chhota Shimla. About two months were spent here in solitude performing Bhajan and Paath (meditation and prayer). Occasionally in the evening, while walking on the Lower Mall, he would go to Dr. Sahib Singh Ji (younger brother of Dr. Diwan Singh Ji). In August 1925, upon the insistence of the Shimla Sangat, the Jatha was called and the program of Diwan congregation was fulfilled there.
His daughter Kartar Kaur's health was quite poor. After getting her treated there for a few days, he took her to Jhang Maghiana, to Dr. Diwan Singh Ji, the Civil Surgeon. Dr. Sahib had already invited Bhai Sahib to stay with him. So he kept Bhai Sahib with him for about a month for complete rest.

**Last Attendance at Sri Nankana Sahib:**
The Katak Purnima (full moon) of 1925 arrived. Bhai Sahib had a vow to attend [on this occasion] throughout his life. Sent a message to the Jatha at Firuka, they [came] from there and he reached Nankana Sahib directly. As always, the Diwan was set in the Pandal of Chief Khalsa Diwan. On the night of the birth [celebration], Kirtan was performed at Janam Asthan. The Sangat was infinite... there was no place to stand. The echoes of the Celestial Bani and Divine Sounds... [when one listens], a strange taste comes.
When Bhai Sahib recited the episode of Bebe Nanki preparing Prashad (food) and waiting for her brother [Guru Nanak], he painted such a picture that cannot be described. Bebe Nanki appeared to be cooking Phulkas right before the eyes, and when Bhai Sahib spoke loudly in a prolonged tone, "Sat Kartar, Bebe Ji Sat Kartar"...
