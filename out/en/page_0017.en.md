## English (Meaning Translation)

**Baba Sahib Singh Ji Bedi** of Una and after him his sons also used to come to Faruka and preach in this very Dharamsala.
The recognition of this Gurdwara was due to the name of Baba Sadhu Sachiar who was a Mahapurush of spiritual earning/power and truth. All the weddings of the village used to take place here only.
In the light of the high and pure life of the Mahapurushas of these abodes, the residents of [Faruka] used to be very religious and God-fearing. They were guileless, simple-natured and contented men. Their dealings were clean and pure. The fraud, black market and deceit of today's era was not seen. [In the matter of] earning wealth...

**Social Life**
Apart from kinship, the rites and customs were also the same. Before the Singh Sabha movement, the same Brahmanical methods were prevalent for the rites of birth, death, marriage etc.

**Establishment of Singh Sabha:**
Due to the Singh Sabha movement running in the Panth, with the inspiration of Bhai Hira Singh Ji, **Sri Guru Singh Sabha Faruka** came into existence in the year 1897-98.
Bhai Bhagwan Singh Ji was appointed the Jathedar and Bhai Hazoor Singh Ji Khurana the Secretary of this Singh Sabha. This Sabha was first affiliated with 'Khalsa Diwan Lahore' and later in 1902 upon the establishment of 'Chief Khalsa Diwan' it got associated with it.

Bhai Hazoor Singh Ji Khurana was a classmate of Bhai Hira Singh Ji in childhood. He contributed significantly to the Singh Sabha Faruka. [Regarding]... Kanya Pathshala (Girls' School) and School, he [worked] with Bhai Hira Singh Ji... [They had] brotherly love for each other. He [served]... passed away in 1919 becoming a victim of the Influenza epidemic.

[In the beginning] there was great opposition to the Singh Sabha in the village and the Singh Sabhias were treated very badly... to the extent that the city dwellers did not even let them fill water from the wells... [If they] touched, then they would wash the rope to purify it and then fill their water.

There was no question of Anand Karaj (Sikh wedding) taking place with the 'Maryada' (Sikh code). The [elders] were adamant on this point that they would conduct weddings only through Bedi (Hindu ritual).

## Notes
- Corrected likely OCR word: "ਫੈ" -> "Influenza" (Context: 1919 Epidemic).
- Corrected likely OCR word: "ਲੱਜ" -> "Lajj" (Rope used for well).
