## English (Meaning Translation)

...Guru Nanak Dev Ji came [under the shade of a Ber tree at Sialkot], this was also an ordinary Ber tree like others, but Satguru rested under it and touched it with his feet, [so] this Ber tree obtained the greatness of Satguru's glimpse. Today 400 years have passed, this Beri became **Ber Sahib**.
This Ber is now preaching to us - 'O lovers! I was a rooted-plant (Jarrh) and by seeing Satguru I reached this status. You being humans are still blank? Reethas (Soapnuts) became sweet by touching Satguru and you are still bitter? Being called Sikhs of Guru Nanak, you are still like others? Come! Touch the feet of Satguru and get softened...'
Hearing this explanation from his (Bhai Hira Singh's) mouth, "Dhan Guru Nanak, Dhan Guru Nanak" used to come out from every pore of loving Sikhs and their soul used to fall at Guru's feet and plead, 'Beloved Guru Nanak! Save us too.' At that time that Ber Sahib comes before eyes...
"Beloved Gursikhs! Now the Conference is at the same place where Ber Sahib is. There itself Bhai Hira Singh Ji will perform loving Kirtan and when facing Ber Sahib he will [sing] Satguru's... Come and reach in large numbers."

On **page 79** [of Golden Jubilee Book?] it is written:
"One used to take all kinds of benefit from Conferences. But the greatest spiritual benefit was from these Conferences. In religious Diwans, top Ragis of the Panth used to perform **Asa Di Var** and after that Katah of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji used to take place..."
In the open and vast grounds of religious Diwans, under canopies, Sangats used to gather in thousands and listen to nectar-like Kirtan, Katah and Lectures. **Sriman Sant Attar Singh** and **Bhai Hira Singh Ji** through Kirtan...
"O people of the world! That Satguru who saved the whole world... humans aside..."

## Notes
- "Jarrh" refers to inanimate/vegetative life (immobile).
- "Reetha Mithay" refers to the Reetha Sahib incident where bitter soapnuts became sweet for Mardana.
