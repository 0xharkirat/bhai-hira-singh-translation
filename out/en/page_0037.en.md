## English (Meaning Translation)

...The main servants of the Diwan were themselves of high character and ideal Gursikhs.
...[Within them] was the passion for selfless service and pure Gurmat preaching.
**Sriman Bhai Sahib Bhai Vir Singh Ji** was a great high, saintly personality who can be called the [Soul?] of the Diwan, but his companions were also owners of high [character?]. For example, everyone knows the high conduct of **Sardar Sundar Singh Ji Majithia**. But I want to tell here an incident seen with my own eyes which influenced me greatly. This matter is of year **1920-21**, when I was studying in [4th?] class. At that time Bhai Hira Singh Ji's residence was at **Chowk Karori** Amritsar. It was often the effort of Sardar Sundar Singh Ji that whenever Bhai Hira Singh Ji stayed in Amritsar for two-four days upon returning from preaching tours, he should perform Kirtan of Asa Di Var at **Majitha House** occasionally.

Accordingly, on one such occasion, Bhai Sahib took me along too at Amrit Vela. Bapu Ji and Jatha had gone to sleep at Majitha House at night itself. At about 4 AM, Bhai Sahib and I reached Majitha House walking. Ahead Bapu Ji and Jatha were performing Kirtan.
It was the days of Assu-Katak (autumn), there was mild cold. In the room where Kirtan was happening, there was dim light like a zero-watt bulb gives. One person... whether anyone else has entered or not. Two-and-a-half hours continuous pure Kirtan.
...Sitting steadfast in cross-legged posture (Chaukra). He had covered his face with a sheet. **Rani Sahib** and other ladies were sitting in the adjacent room. Bhai Sahib bowed before Maharaj and sat near his Vaja (harmonium) and I sat behind him...
...remained happening, but the gentleman sitting wrapped up remained sitting in absolute stillness. I kept watching with attention. Neither he changed his sitting posture, nor lifted his knee, nor looked towards Ragi Singhs. And I kept wondering that some Saint-Mahatma has come, but where is Sardar Ji himself?
...[Later I found] that was [Sardar Sundar] Singh Ji, who was so connected and sitting absolutely engrossed. And about **Sardar Tarlochan Singh Ji** it is also said that in his youth... he used to fill the presence at Sri Darbar Sahib... and used to do service in Parikarma.
Such were the lives of the [pillars] of Singh Sabha and Chief Khalsa Diwan. Then why wouldn't the tasks initiated by such colored leaders be accomplished? Why wouldn't the programs made [by them] succeed?

The above example is of the chief servants who used to chalk out the programs and make policies of the Diwan. But those who were to practicalize these programs... the preachers... they were also gentlemen of high life and dedication, because if the preacher's own life is not high, his lectures [will have no effect]...
