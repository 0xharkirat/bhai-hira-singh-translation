## English (Meaning Translation)

**Morcha Guru Ka Bagh:**
In **August 1922**, for cutting wood for Guru Ka Langar from the land of Gurdwara Guru Ka Bagh which is few miles from Amritsar... on complaint of **Mahant Sundar Das**, **Panja Singh** was imprisoned. Challenging this... many Singhs reached there and they were also imprisoned. Enthusiasm increased further and on 26 August, 60 Singhs were arrested. Then on 31 August regular Morcha started.
ASP was one Englishman named **Beaty**, who had given order to beat Jathas with sticks (lathis). After getting beaten when Singhs used to become unconscious, they were brought back to Amritsar. These Jathas continued for many months. Finally **Sir Ganga Ram** intervened and paying the price of that garden from his own pocket to the Mahant, got the possession of garden given to Singhs. In this way Government saved its face and on **20 November 1922** the Morcha ended. In this Morcha **5605 Singhs** were arrested.

For this Morcha, daily in the evening huge Diwans used to be held at **Guru Ka Bagh (near Manji Sahib)** in which **Bhai Hira Singh Ji** used to fill enthusiasm in Sangats by narrating martyrdom history along with Kirtan.

**Kar Sewa Sri Darbar Sahib Amritsar:**
During the days of Akali movement only, the program for **Kar Sewa** (cleaning of tank) of Sri Darbar Sahib was made. Therefore, an attempt is made to give a brief view of this unique service below.
The date for taking out silt from the Sarovar of Sri Darbar Sahib was fixed as **17 June 1923**. On 17 June at Amrit Vela, a huge Diwan of Khalsa was held at **Gurdwara Pipli Sahib**. In that the estimate of Sangat was about **three lakhs**. **Sri Sant Attar Singh Ji** was sitting in Tabia of Maharaj and Kirtan of Asa Di Var was performed by **Bhai Bhag Singh Hira Singh Ji's** Jatha. At quarter past five a miracle happened!
A Hawk (Baaz) came from Khalsa College side and after circumambulating (Parikarma) the Sangats went back. There was stir in Sangats but soon silence prevailed due to enjoyment of Kirtan.

After the Bhog of Diwan, the Sangat in form of a procession, amid the sound of love-filled Shabad and thunder of Jakaras, started moving towards Darbar Sahib. Akali Jathas in [blue?] dresses were showing a scene of heavenly glory. Then Nirmalas, Udasins...
Here exactly at 10 o'clock, Bhog of five Akhand Paths fell at Sri Akal Takht!
**Maharaja Bhupinder Singh of Patiala** came to Akal Takht and begged for Amrit. After imposing Tankhah (penance), he was administered Amrit and then Maharaja performed Kar Sewa...

## Notes
