## English (Meaning Translation)

[Context: Jatha arrived to celebrate Gurpurab of Puranmashi]
...reached to celebrate Gurpurab, then Mahant prohibited them from coming to Chhats (roofed place/platform) place. Because at Nankana Sahib [Mahant's guards were everywhere]. No other such place could be found [to hold Diwan]... on which Mahant had no control. So great difficulty [arose].
...found out that one **10 Bigha compound** belonging to **Sardar Balaka Singh** of village **Kaunke**... could be used for holding Diwan. So contacting **Bhai Kartar Singh Ji**, after much effort its usage [permission] was obtained.
In the night Diwan when Bhai Hira Singh Ji mentioned this incident, Sangats expressed great regret upon listening. On Bhai Sahib's appeal, immense money was collected to buy this compound and when it was bought, the Mahant by doing [mischief/litigation?] took it back. Again it was bought in the name of **Sardar Mangal Singh Man Kot Shera**.

In Diwans of following years, by appealing to Sangats, many rooms were built there for residence and every year maximum festivities used to be held at **Chief Khalsa Diwan's Diwan Asthan**. Bhai Hira Singh Ji throughout his life used to attend Sri Nankana Sahib every year on **Katak Puranmashi Gurpurab** and used to preach Dharma in Sangats through Kirtan for three days at Chief Khalsa Diwan's congregation place.
...
From the above difficulties it can be experienced how much pain Sangats must have felt inside. The huge income of Gurdwara property, instead of being spent on Gurmat preaching or service of Gurdwara buildings, was spent by Mahants on their luxury and debauchery. Result was that character of Mahants fell. Instead of Gurmat they started walking on Durmat (evil path). Sikh Sangats could not tolerate this. Slowly, resentment grew inside and finally on **20 February 1921**, with the martyrdom of Singhs, the Birth Place of World-Savior Guru Nanak Dev Ji was liberated from the rule of Mahants. Along with this enthusiasm in Akali movement increased.

After Panth's possession of Janam Asthan, the Janam-Raat (Birth Night) Diwan again started being held fearlessly till Janam [time?] and Bhai Hira Singh Ji performed Kirtan service in **1925**...
In the end, upon Bhai Hira Singh Ji's departure to Gurpuri, in the Sikh number of **'Phulwari'**, the article which **Giani Hira Singh Ji 'Dard'** Editor published under title 'Crown of Panth's Immortal Martyrs', that is given in the end of this [chapter/book].
