## English (Meaning Translation)

At this time [1893] his grandson Hira Singh born from his... was about 13 years old. Child Hira Singh enjoyed the love of his grandfather to the fullest and memorized Gurbani prayers sitting in his lap. Bhai Hira Singh Ji used to mention this himself.

The husband of his beloved Aunt (Bhua), **Bhai Jawahar Singh Ji**, was a very Gurmukh and sweet-spoken gentleman. Upon the colonization of Sargodha, he opened a cloth shop there, which ran well until the partition of the country. Bhua Ji passed away in 1947 in Sargodha itself after living an age of about 97 years, and Bhaiaya Jawahar Singh Ji settled in Faridkot with his family. Here he passed away in 1952 at the age of over 100 years.

Bhai Hira Singh Ji's maternal grandfather (Nana), **Bhai Bhag Singh Ji Gand**, was a reputed gentleman and a wealthy landlord of the area. His father, Bhai Sewa Singh Ji, was a very Gurmukh and pious man, and grandfather Sardar Jassa Singh, being a recognized leader of his area, was appointed a Sardar of the Khalsa Armies. He had great influence during the Sikh Raj.

The ownership of land was mostly with Muslims, but whatever land belonged to non-Muslims, the largest share of ancestral land belonged to Bhai Bhag Singh Ji Gand, which was on wells. When the canal came at the end of the nineteenth century, Bhai Bhag Singh Ji Gand purchased 29 squares (725 acres) of canal land five-six miles away from Faruka and settled his own village, which became famous as **Kot Bhai Bhag Singh**. Thus the influence and awe of Bhai Bhag Singh Ji increased even more. The Kaliars, before whom no one could raise their eyes, Bhai Bhag Singh Gand had the capacity to clash with them if needed.

The eldest daughter of Bhai Bhag Singh Ji Gand, **Srimati Sat Bharai**, had the honor of being the blessed mother of Bhai Hira Singh. Younger to her were three boys and four girls.

Bhai Hira Singh Ji's maternal uncles (Mama), Bhai Bhagwan Singh Ji (1864-1947), Bhai Jawahar Singh Ji (1867-1939) and Bhai Ram Singh Ji (1881-1933) were also perfect Gursikhs and reputed gentlemen like their ancestors, and were founders of Sri Guru Singh Sabha Faruka. The elder Mama, Bhai Bhagwan Singh Ji, remained the Jathedar of Singh Sabha and President of the Managing Committee of Khalsa High School Faruka throughout his life. Then he went to Lahore and started business and progressed a lot in the economic aspect.

## Notes
- Corrected likely OCR word: "ਸਿਕਾ-ਸੱਧਰਾਂ" -> "Sik-Saddran" (Longings/Prayers).
- Corrected likely OCR word: "ਗੰਢ" -> "Gand" (Last name/Clan).
- Corrected likely OCR word: "ਮਰੱਬੇ" -> "Murabba" (Unit of land measurement, approx 25 acres per square usually, text says 25 acres/square implies big land). Note: 1 Murabba is usually 25 acres. 29 Murabba = 725 acres matches text math.
