**A Prominent Builder of the Second Phase of Singh Sabha Movement**
*Giani Mehar Singh Rawel, Ex-Editor,*
*'Khalsa Advocate', 10-17 May 1976*

The Singh Sabha Movement started in the year 1872 [1873]. Its first main builders [were] S. Thakur Singh Sandhawalia (passed away 18 Aug 1887), S. Attar Singh Ji Rais Bhadaur (10 June 1896), Prof. Gurmukh Singh Ji (24 Sept 1898), Giani Ditt Singh Ji (6 Sept 1901), Baba Khem Singh Ji Bedi (11 April 1905) and Bhai Jawahar Singh Ji (14 May 1910). With the closing of eyes (death) of these Panth Servants, the sparkle of the light of Singh Sabha Movement became dim. ...
In this second phase, the great service that Bhai Hira Singh Ji Ragi did to flourish the Gursikh Garden through Kirtan, Exegesis (Viakhya), Discourse (Katha) and Lectures via preaching tours in entire India and Burma, is beyond the power of any single individual. ...
As long as Bhai Hira Singh Ji lived, he lived for the preaching of the objectives of the Singh Sabha Movement, lived for the Panth and died for the Panth only.

## Notes
- Historical context provided by Giani Mehar Singh Rawel.
