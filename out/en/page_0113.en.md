## English (Meaning Translation)

...described the influence of Bhai Hira Singh Ji's speech like this [by Qureshi Ali Mardan Shah]:
"This district has great pride of being the birthplace of holy and high personality of **Gurpuri-dweller Bhai Sahib Bhai Hira Singh Ji Ragi**. Whosoever has heard Bhai Sahib's Kirtan, can never forget that Priceless Diamond of Sikh Panth."
He said that Bani of Guru Granth Sahib Ji is matchless. Then as an example Qureshi Ji recited these lines:
*At Sundar Kulin Chatur Mukh Gyani Dhanvanta ||*
*Mirtak Kahi-eh Nanka Jih Preet Nahi Bhagvanta ||*
(Extremely beautiful, high-born, clever, wise speaker and wealthy; O Nanak, dead they are called, who have no love for Lord.)
(Guru Granth Sahib, Ang 253)

I was surprised and asked Qureshi Ji how do you remember this Shabad? He told that "At some time I had heard Kirtan of Bhai Hira Singh Ji and the effect it had on heart, is remembered till now."

**Influence on Arya Samaj Leader:**
In **1917**, in the religious Diwan of **Sikh Educational Conference Lahore**, famous **Arya Samaji Leader, Lala Hans Raj Ji, Principal D.A.V. College Lahore** also arrived at Amrit Vela to listen to Bhai Sahib's Kirtan. He listened to Kirtan with one-pointed focus and upon Bhog when one of his companions asked about Kirtan, then Lala Hans Raj Ji replied, "For four hours nectar-rain has been happening, from which I am departing satisfied."

**Story of Padi Darveza:**
At a religious Diwan congregation held in **1911** at **Padi Darveza, District Jhelum (Pakistan)**, both Bhai Hira Singh Ji and **Sant Attar Singh Ji** arrived. Flows of Kirtan ran and Gurmat was preached. There, outside the town at a little distance there was a small water spring, which was called **'Tukni Wala Choha'**. Here water fell from some height, man could bathe standing below. In that area there was great danger of a **Hooded Sheshnag (Cobra)** and no one used to go to that place at all times; cattle, men all stayed away.
Days were of Assu-Katik (Autumn). One day at Amrit Vela, Bhai Hira Singh Ji... went there early morning and bathing at that spring, sat on a big stone and started doing Path or Bhajan Simran.
Numberdar of that place, **Zamindar Karamdad Khan** and **Niamat Ali**, both brothers came with plough... then from distance they saw a man in white clothes sitting on stone, reading something...

## Notes
