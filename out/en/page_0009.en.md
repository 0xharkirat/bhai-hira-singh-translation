## English (Meaning Translation)

...narrating the stories of martyrdom in the Diwans to fill the congregation with zeal for the agitation; giving visible Darshan of Guru Nanak Sahib in the Diwans at Sri Nankana Sahib on Katik Purnima; doing Kirtan in solitude sitting on sand dunes with a small harmonium at night when visiting home at Faruka; and remaining engrossed in meditation during the day—these are such events that are etched on my mind.

In 1924, I had the opportunity to observe his life closely by staying with him for about two months in Koh Mari and Dumel etc., and in the summer of 1925 in Shimla. And then I had the good fortune of serving him during the last 5 months of 1926... [my duty] was to recite prayers. Apart from this, I also got the opportunity to serve with my own hands.

In these very days, upon passing Matric in June 1926, you sent me to Amritsar to get admission in Khalsa College and ordered me to first go and have Darshan of Sriman Bhai Sahib Bhai Vir Singh Ji at Lawrence Road. Accordingly, reaching there, Sri Bhai Sahib Ji kept me with him, and the next day when Principal Gopala Rao came to see him, he handed me over to him. He took me with him to the college and completed the admission formalities. I came back to Lawrence Road. In the evening after tea, when he was leaving for Majitha House to play badminton sitting in his Victoria carriage, he took me along too. I sat on the floor of the carriage at his feet, but he caught me by the arm and lifted me up, hugged me to his chest with love, and seating me on the seat opposite him said, "Why are you sitting on the floor? Do you know whose son you are? Your father is a 'Genius', a 'Genius'." At that time I did not even know the full meaning of this word, but this word 'Genius' kept echoing in my ears all my life.

...And now, half a century after his passing, when I read the main article 'Empty Space in the Panth' in the Khalsa Samachar issue of 30 September 1926, I realized why Sriman Bhai Sahib Bhai Vir Singh Ji had used this word for Bhai Hira Singh Ji.

He has written in one place in this article: "In Bhai Hira Singh Ji, there was a sense of religion, a passion for Simran, an inner love for Gurbani; in the understanding of the essence of Gurbani and the life of the Satgurus, he had the experience of the level of poetry; then with Kirtan there was a mastery of eloquence; there was blessing in his speech - a gift of the Lord - but the features of his inner religious emotion showed the perfection of art and skill in his speech..."

Regarding the early life of Bhai Hira Singh Ji and his father and grandfather, we [knew some facts]... and about the life after his marriage (1894), our mother, Srimati Prem Kaur Ji used to tell us a lot, but to organize these, in 1962-63, we recorded them on tape by asking her in the form of questions and answers.

## Notes
- Corrected likely OCR word: "ਅਖਰੀ" -> likely context implies "Baani" or specific prayer recitation duty.
- Corrected likely OCR word: "ਪਟ" -> "ਪਰ" (But).
