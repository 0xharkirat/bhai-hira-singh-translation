## English (Meaning Translation)

**A Blessing**

Your decision to write the biography of your father, Bhai Hira Singh Ji, is highly commendable. This biography is about such a revered Gursikh who will provide light and guidance to every Sikh for their life.

It is rare to find such a selfless servant, a complete Gursikh, a Kirtan performer of the highest order, free from greed, attachment, and ego. Waheguru, through His grace, sends such noble souls only occasionally for the benefit of the common people, and they leave their indelible mark, which continues to show its effect forever.

The immense effort you have put in and the collection of all this material is also a great service to the Panth (the Sikh community). Spending so much, undertaking so many journeys, and gathering all this information from various places—this is a great endeavor and an act of benevolence towards the Panth.

By reading this biography, Sikhs will continue to benefit, and it will continue to provide guidance for them to lead their lives as Gursikhs. I congratulate you.

## Notes
- Corrected likely OCR word: "ਨਿਰਸੋਲਕ" -> "ਨਿਰਸਵਾਰਥ" (reason: context requires 'selfless' or 'guileless' servant, fitting the list of virtues).
- Corrected likely OCR word: "ਇਰ" -> "ਇਹ" (reason: grammatical necessity, referring to 'this material').
- Unclear text: The final lines following "Former Governor, Rajasthan" are highly garbled OCR noise and have been marked as [UNCLEAR].
