## English (Meaning Translation)

According to historian **Baba Prem Singh Ji Hoti**...
[Dr. Ratan Singh?] was son of... First he became **Assistant Surgeon** and approximately in **1903** or one-two years before that, when Frontier Province was newly formed, he was posted at **Mardan**. Bhai Bhag Singh Hira Singh Ji's Ragi Jatha was at peak of Kirtan in those days and Bhai Sahib Ji's love with them was of extreme degree. There Kirtan Diwans, Gurpurb congregations were held and spiritual waves moved... on secluded riverside, mountain peaks, **Takht-i-Bahi**, **Shahbaz Garhi** where Ashoka's inscription is lying and other secluded scenic wildernesses, Kirtan was performed in state of Nirban (bliss).

Listening to Bhai Hira Singh Ji's Kirtan, Doctor Sahib often used to get teary-eyed and absorbed in juice (Ras). Yes, that Nirankari Kirtan, listening to which mind leaving extroverted pursuits concentrates in its own light-form essence:
*Satsangat Sai Har Teri Jit Har Kirat Har Sunne ||*
(That is Your True Congregation, O Lord, where Your Praise is heard.)
(Guru Granth Sahib, Ang 1135)

In **1908-09** he became **Civil Surgeon** and went to **Shimla**, then **Dera Ghazi Khan**, **Gurdaspur**, **Lyallpur**, **Jhang** etc. Wherever he went, he spread fragrance of Satsang. In **1926** when he went for tour of **England** (Vilayat), then Bhai Hira Singh Ji met him at **Jhang Station** and boarding the train went with him till **Lodhran** doing Satsang! While he was in England, Bhai Sahib passed away. From there he sent telegrams and letters of condolence.
Retiring in **1930**, he first came to Shimla and then **Rawalpindi**. In **April 1934** conference he met with great warmth and hugging me said, 'Today I have met beloved Bhai Hira Singh.' In June due to tooth extraction... trouble increased and finally in His Will on **15.9.1934** he went to Guru's feet.

**Bhai Sant Singh Ji Garhi Kapura:**
Four or five miles from **Mardan**, there was a village named **Garhi Kapura**. Here lived Gurmukh Beloved **Bhai Sant Singh Ji (1880-1965)**, whose fragrance of philanthropy was spread in whole Frontier, whose facial smile had magnetic attraction and whose quivering lips had vibration of Simran.
He was crazy (devotee) of Kirtan. Whenever Bhai Sahib went to Mardan, then [he visited] Garhi Kapura...
