## English (Meaning Translation)

...buildings of Boarding, Hospital and one Gurdwara were completed.
In the remaining land, apart from sports and big grounds, a **Well** was installed, from which arrangements were made for growing vegetables etc. for Langar in the remaining land.

**Education and Religious Instruction:**
From the beginning, it was the effort of organizers that staff appointed should be most capable and of religious inclination. Due to this, school results always came out good. Along with studies, special attention was paid to religious education, Kirtan, Paath and Gurbani.
It was Bhai Hira Singh Ji's own rule that whenever he returned home from preaching tours outside, he would first mark his attendance in the school! He would give [instruction/lecture] to the senior class. His great desire was that students passing out from this school should be samples of Sikhism and a mission in themselves.
[Due to this influence] students used to come out becoming firm Gursikhs. Even now students educated at Faruka are met who have the influence of Bhai Sahib's teachings and they [recite Gurbani] while sitting and standing...

Hearing this fame, many students from far off places used to come to take admission in Faruka. For example, **Sardar Sahib Lakhmi Singh**, Retired Principal Government Technical School Ambala, has stated in answer to our query:
"After passing six classes from the only Middle School of my area **Naushehra** District Sargodha, I took admission in **Mission School Gujrat**, where my elder brother was working as overseer. Upon coming First in the very first exam, the pious Headmaster of the school called me and gave Shabaash (praise) and also instructed the religious teacher to take special care of me. From that day they started taking care that I should become Christian by some greed or love. Christian religious books were given to me for free... Headmaster Sahib called me home and persuaded me to change religion. I came and [told] one of my [relatives?]...
[He said] 'There is a Khalsa School in **Faruka** which is under the patronage of Bhai Sahib Bhai Hira Singh Ji... and is an ideal school.'
...I got the certificate and in **1918** passed eighth class..."
