**Detachment from Maya (Wealth):**
There is no doubt that Bhai Hira Singh Ji's means of livelihood was Guru's Kirtan only, and being a householder he had [needs], but as Principal Jodh Singh Ji has written, his main purpose was preaching, not collecting wealth.
When we look at the few years of Bhai Hira Singh Ji's life, we find that more than half of his time was spent in works of Panthic construction. The time when he started doing Kirtan (1897-98) was also the time when the great works of the Singh Sabha movement began. Establishing Khalsa College and opening Khalsa Schools in various places—in all these tasks, Bhai Hira Singh Ji dedicated his service, and the money received during that time was offered to that institution. For the preaching fund of Chief Khalsa Diwan and for the Diwan's ashrams (Orphanage Amritsar and Gharjakh, Preacher's School Tarn Taran, etc.), Bhai Hira Singh Ji's service was ever ready to meet their financial needs.

The tireless service he rendered for Khalsa School Firuka is hard to match. From 1907 to 1916-17, for about ten years, he remained engaged in constructing the vast buildings of the school. The entire burden of this school was on this single soul, which he carried on his head while fulfilling all [preaching] programs. Therefore, it is not difficult to guess where the money received from his Kirtan went.

As far as his personal needs were concerned, Bhai Hira Singh Ji's life was of extreme simplicity and his own or family needs were very limited. His effort was that whatever money came should be spent more and more on Panthic works.

When money started pouring in during Kirtans, he would often say, "Khalsa Ji! Keep your money safe. If you have love for the Plumed Guru (Guru Gobind Singh), then become his true Sikhs and take Amrit. And Sehajdhari brothers! Be prepared for the Amrit of the Double-Edged Sword (Khande Di Pahul)." And the effect of these words was such that [money would rain down?]. The question of settling a fee for Kirtan never arose.

One day, respected Sant Nischal Singh Ji Maharaj, mentioning Bhai Sahib's detachment, told that in the summer of 1925, having spent a few days with Bhai Hira Singh Ji...
