## English (Meaning Translation)

[Someone said]: "...[opposition/trouble] is happening... so you go back.
Forgive me, here many settlers are owners of Murabbas (squares of land) [and vast properties], first of all [I] was going to perform the Anand of my daughter, but all these people do not agree in any way. So you please go back."
Hearing this I said to that Sardar, "We will go, but before going let us at least say Sat Sri Akal to the mother of the girl. He said, 'Bhai Sahib! You don't go and don't get yourself insulted.' But I forcibly went to his house along with him and went and said, 'Bebe Ji! Sat Kartar.' She replied, 'Come Bhai Ji, Sat Sri Akal!'

'Bebe Ji! Is it your own daughter's wedding?'
'Yes, Bhai Ji, she is my own daughter.'
'Are you real mother or step-mother? Tell the truth.'
'No Bhai Sahib, speak auspicious words.'
'We ask are you the real mother? We have a doubt that you are not the real mother, because I have heard that you have said "If Guru Nanak Dev Ji, Guru Gobind Singh Ji True Father come in my daughter's wedding, then I will jump in the well and drown"... Do [mothers] say this?'

Next, with folded hands that lady said, 'Waheguru Waheguru, when did I say this? May my mouth return [words]... At my daughter's Anand Karaj, Guru Nanak, Guru [Gobind Singh]... come to my house?'
Bhai Sahib said, 'Bravo Mother, blessed are you. Then consider Guru Baba Ji has come, you spread the mats...'

Going to the Gurdwara, performing Kirtan [in front of] the simple Palanquin of Sri Guru Baba Ji, roaring Jaikaras... came [to the house]. Reformed the Gurmata. This miracle of Guru happened...
