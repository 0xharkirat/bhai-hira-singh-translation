## English (Meaning Translation)

...lived on chewing sorghum [stalks]... He insisted that 'I will take Amrit only from the hands of Bhai Hira Singh Ji (who was his brother-in-law in relation).'
A letter was sent to **Bhai Khushal Singh** (his elder brother) who was working in Karachi at that time...
The Chaudhary of the village **Bhai Tarlok Singh Ji** explained to **Bhai Khem Chand** not to trouble the child, lest he takes some other [drastic] step. Upon this Bhai Khem Chand gave permission to take Amrit.
This is the same **Sardar Arjan Singh** whose firm is famous in Delhi and Bombay by the name of **'Arjan Singh Khem Chand'**. He himself narrated this story to the author in Ludhiana on **20 May 1979**, and said, "I had earned Sikhism at a very high cost." (It is sad that S. Arjan Singh (born 1903) passed away on 12.11.1988).

Such was the attraction of Bhai Sahib's Amrit Prachar.
Regarding an Amrit Prachar held on the occasion of a religious Diwan at **Mandi Bahauddin** (Gujarat, Pakistan), **Bhai Sudh Singh Ji Ragi**, who had reached there, wrote in his [article]:
"In this Diwan Bhai Hira Singh Ji made four appeals, [three] were successful... Sangats rained money like cloud and filled the bags.
On the third day in the evening Diwan, he took me (Bhai Sudh Singh Ji) along... The Diwan was full. **Bhai Kartar Singh Ji**... finished his speech and sat down. Bhai Hira Singh Ji made me stand on the stage [and said]:
'...Like a cloud you have rained money and accepted those demands, but one demand, one hunger is still left. Bhai Sudh Singh is your Kirtaniya, this servant asks for something by spreading his shirt-front (Jholi). Fill the bag of your servant. He asks that today some Keshadhari (with hair) become firm [Singh?], and becoming son of the Plume-Wearer (Guru Gobind Singh), increase the glory of Khalsa Panth...'
...I am present with family, administer Amrit to us, make us Singhs...
...Bhai Nain Das, third Bhai Sohan Lal and similarly in half an hour... many Sehajdhari families entered the sphere of Sikhism." (Khalsa Samachar 30.9.192[?])
