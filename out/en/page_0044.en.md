## English (Meaning Translation)

...eyes that could meet [God?].
...used to perform Katah and Amrit Prachar.
...with great spiritual experience...
On the Gurpurab of Vaisakhi [1918], **Sant Attar Singh Ji Mastuana** [came]...
Two days before Vaisakhi, Baba [Attar Singh] Ji...
...famous historian... daily Sri Guru [Granth]...
...started giving motivation to [Sangats?]. This [is about] year 1917 or...
**Bhai Hira Singh Ji**...
**[Baba] Hoti Mardan (1882-?)**...
...sent a message to **Sant Singh Ji** that Sant [Attar Singh] should make some effort for Sehajdharis to become Keshadhari.
[Looking at Bhai Hira Singh], Sant Ji said that on the day of Vaisakhi...
...that report which was in Persian language, you recite it to the Sangat in its original form.
[Bhai Hira Singh] Ji recited that report in Persian language and told its meanings:
*Hamah Ha Yak Mazhabe Shawad*
(You all should come into one religion)
*Har Char Baran Kaume Hanood Baham*
(All four castes of Hindus together)
*Yake Khud Ra Bar Digre Tarjih Na Dahad*
(No one should consider himself superior to another)
*Piyale Man Gariifta Marduma Har Chahar Yag Ja Nash Bikhurand*
*Az Yag Lota*
(People of all four [castes] should take the bowl held by me and drink from one place/pot)
(Hearing this, many Brahmins and Khatris got up [and left])
*Hazar Kass Raza Dadand*
(Thousand people gave consent)

This was the account of the day of Amrit administration written in **Aurangzeb's Daily Diary** (Roznamcha), which Bhai Hira Singh Ji narrated to the Sangat and Sikh Sehajdharis. When Bhai [Sahib narrated that] **20,000** people took Amrit, then **Sant Baba Attar Singh Ji** said, "O Sehajdhari gentlemen! Is there anyone among you, who takes the pledge to become Keshadhari right now?"
...[Someone] stood up and said, "I should be given the gift of Amrit."
Then what was there, from among Sehajdhari Sikhs **Nand Lal Ji** of Mandi, **Asa Nand Ji** of [Rina?], and **Lal Chand Ji**... and many other... got up and writing their names kept sitting on one side.

## Notes
- Corrected likely OCR word: "ਹਮਹ ਹਾਂ ਯਕ ਮਜ਼ਹਬੇ" -> "Hamah Ra Yak Mazhabe".
- Corrected likely OCR word: "ਔਰੰਗਜ਼ੇਬ" -> "Aurangzeb" (Mughal Emperor - usually this report is attributed to a spy or newswriter of the court).
