## English (Meaning Translation)

...For the Langar of [Orphans], Gurmukh Pyare **Bhai Amar Singh Ji Gandha** offered **6 Murabbas** (150 acres) land from his Chitraur land to the school... this transfer was registered in the name of the school in **1922-23**.

**Servant's Love Lasted till the End:**
Bhai Sahib departed for Gurpuri (passed away) on **2 September 1926**. His passing caused an unbearable loss to the whole Panth generally and to Faruka School [specifically].
In the speech **Bhai Sham Singh Ji** gave with a heavy heart at his Bhog (last rites), the estimate of his grief can be made from just one sentence. He said, "People while condoling me say 'Your arm is broken', but I say my whole body is gone, I am left as just one arm."

Bhai Sahib had immense love for Faruka School. In his **Will** [he wrote]:
"Faruka School is my beloved object and property of Guru Panth. All Sangats who will help in its growth and blossoming will obtain Guru's pleasure. Especially regarding school, the running of Hospital and building of beautiful Gurdwara, these are my strong desires which are yet in between (unfinished), Satguru's Rangeela Panth will fulfill them."
Committee had been formed and Bhai Sham Singh Ji was performing the service of Manager since then.

**After passing of Bhai Hira Singh Ji:** [School continued...]

**Re-establishment:**
The Partition of **1947** [destroyed] the vast belongings of Faruka School...
...Establishment of Khalsa High School 1908...
...Selfless and unique service of Panth Jewel Bhai Sahib Bhai Hira Singh Ji Ragi...
...was in (Pakistan).
[The buildings were left in Pakistan but the spirit crossed the border.]

## Notes
- "Murabba" is approx 25 acres. Bequest of 6 Murabbas is a huge donation.
