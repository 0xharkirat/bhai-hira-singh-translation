...
Blessed are those ears which heard this,
Those ears were filled with the relish of Kirtan.
Like the waves of the rivers...
You created the sweet tune of Kirtan...
...
...
Sweet, smiling and grave/deep...
...
The whole universe is singing in the same tune...
...
You sang Asa Di Var or the call of Sadar (Evening prayer)...
...

## Notes
- Poem describing the mesmerizing effect of his Kirtan.
- "Sadar Di Hoka": Call of the evening/reverence.
