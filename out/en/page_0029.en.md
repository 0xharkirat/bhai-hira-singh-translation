## English (Meaning Translation)

...relatives [also] put many hurdles to stop him, but one who is colored in His love, who can stop his way?
[He] departed. Before leaving, the wife wanted to check what will [we eat/do] there... "We are going to the city of Guru Ram Das, He himself will do everything."

**At Amritsar:**
Reaching Sri Amritsar, the couple first arrived at **Kucha Basti Ram**. (Here lived **Bhai Amir Singh Ji**, guru-brother of Bhai Jiwan Singh Ji of Faruka, whose Dharamsala in Faruka was in the street of Bhai Hira Singh and which has been mentioned in 'Birth Place' section.) Bhai Ji welcomed the couple and gave accommodation with great love, but after a short while, he took a room on rent in the same street and moved there.
From here, giving broom service in the circumambulation (Parikarma) of Sri Darbar Sahib morning and evening, doing service of the Sarovar (holy tank), serving water at Chhabils and cleaning shoes (Joda), this was the daily program.

**Service of Khalsa Tract Society:**
This was the time when Guru-beloved **Bhai Sahib (Bhai Vir Singh)** used to do service... The attire was such that no one could recognize him. This mention is of the year **1896** when the age of Bhai Sahib Bhai Vir Singh Ji was 24 years and that of Bhai Hira Singh was 17 years. The residence of Bhai Sahib Bhai Vir Singh was then in Katra Garba Singh. By the Creator's will, how the sight of Bhai Sahib Ji fell on young Bhai Hira Singh. There was one way to reach Sri Darbar Sahib and Bhai Hira Singh Ji also used to do Sevain Parikarma at Amrit Vela. So his discerning eye recognized that this young man is capable of doing service with dedication. Therefore, he engaged Bhai Hira Singh in a service of **Khalsa Tract Society**. Due to this, he not only got the opportunity to read the tracts of Sriman Bhai Sahib Ji, but also obtained the clue of Bhai Sahib being [a great soul].

Along with the service of Tract Society, his routine of service at Sri Darbar Sahib continued as before. In this regard, **Sir Manmohan Singh Ji**, 'Kails' Wale... writes in 'Khalsa Samachar': "We see this young man (Bhai Hira Singh) in the morning at Amrit Vela... at Darbar Sahib... waking up early in the morning... works whole day... it is surprising. Bhai Sahib Ji caught the arm of this young man working in the afternoon..."

## Notes
- Corrected likely OCR word: "ਪੁੰਜ" -> "Pujj" (Reach/Arrive).
- Corrected likely OCR word: "ਕੌਲੇ" -> "Joda" (Shoes/Sandals - doing shoe service). Or could be "Kole" (Bowls), but context of Seva usually implies Jora/Shoes.
