...[I] kept watching the brilliance of knowledge and his forehead in the dim light of the lamp.
Around 4:30 [AM], he got up and said "Let's go," taking me along to the congregation (Diwan). That very day, I understood the secret of his melodious Kirtan, the fascinating explanation falling from his lotus mouth, and his spotless character.

When [Sant Nischal] Singh Ji was still a humble servant (sevak), once Bhai Hira Singh Ji came to stay for a day or two at Mane Tiwana on his return from a sacrificial congregation (Jag Samagam) of Bhai Gurditt Shah Singh at Mianwali. Mahant Sahib arranged his stay in the upper room (*chubara*) and assigned the duty of looking after Bhai Hira Singh Ji to you (Sri Sant Ji).

[He used to] take his harmonium into the gorges of the mountains and on the banks of rivers, and would sit there for many hours absorbed in wondrous colors, enjoying the divine sight.

Once during the summer when he went to Koh Mari (Murree), as S. Sham Singh Ji, President of Kuari Gurdwara, tells in the issue of *Khalsa Samachar* dated 30.8.1951: One night... [sound through] door. My mind was attracted and I got up and walked in the direction of the Shabad. What did I see? In desolate solitude, Bhai Hira Singh Ji was alone, enjoying the essence of Kirtan. After the Kirtan of this Shabad, he started another Shabad: *"Tum chandan ham irand bapure sang tumare basa"* (You are sandalwood, I am the poor castor plant, abiding near you). And when he sang these lines:

> *Hum supan hum jas kira ||*
> *Satsangat mil hoiay madhup makhira ||*
> (SGGS Ang 486)

Then he became so absorbed in the *ras* (essence) of these lines that he remained silent for a long time. When it became Amrit Vela (ambrosial hour), he took his harmonium and joined his companions at the Gurdwara to engage in Kirtan, distributing the Ambrosial Essence (Amrit Ras) to the congregation.

Chaudhry Ji used to say that in the evening I asked Bhai Hira Singh Ji, "Today at night when you were performing Kirtan in the mountain caves, why did you remain silent for a long time after reciting those lines?" At first, he looked at me with surprise and then said, "In Srinagar, silkworms are reared, aren't they? From some, white silk is produced, and from others, yellow. White silk is considered very precious. Taking this thought, I became absorbed in gratitude for the Guru's grace..."
*"Akirtghana nu palda, Prabh Nanak sad bakhsind"* (He nourishes the ungrateful, O Nanak, God is forever forgiving). We are also worms of the holy congregation (*Humm kire kiram*)...

## Notes
- "ਮਗੁਰ ਮੁੱਖ" (Magur mukh?): Likely "Mukharbind" or "Kamal mukh" context implies "Lotus mouth" or "Sweet mouth". Translated as "lotus mouth".
- "ਪੁਰਾੜਾਂ ਦੀਆਂ ਖੱਡਾਂ" (Paharan diyan khaddan): "Mountain gorges".
