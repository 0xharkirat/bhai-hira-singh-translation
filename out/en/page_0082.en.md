## English (Meaning Translation)

...In this connection, **Professor Sahib Singh Ji (1892-1977)** has written on page 105 of his autobiography **'Meri Jiwan Kahani'** -
"Seeing this massacre my tears flowed out, weeping could not be stopped... I returned, towards inside the Gurdwara. **Bhai Hira Singh Ji Ragi** was sitting in Tabia (service) of that Guru Granth Sahib, in which 5-7 bullets from Sadhus' guns had hit. Bhai Sahib seeing me said, 'Bhai Sahib Singh! Look, bullets have hit the chest of Satguru Ji' and saying this he wept bitterly!"

**Cremation of Martyrs:**
On **22 February 1921**, Panth leaders consulted and decided that cremation of martyr Singhs should be done only when the Governor Sahib himself comes and sees this painful scene with his own eyes. So according to this decision **Sardar Harbans Singh Attari** sent a telegram to the Lat Sahib... On **23 February**, **Sir Edward Maclagan** (Governor) came. All conditions inside were shown to the Lat Sahib... At that time Governor's attitude was full of sympathy and he said, 'Justice will be done.' ...
Akalis raised various slogans. At that time about 40-50 thousand Sangat [had gathered].
Bhai Hira Singh Ji Ragi taking Sangat along went outside near potters' (Kumhars) kilns to collect the bodies. They made a small palanquin and wherever they found any piece of flesh, picking it up they placed it in that...
Leading ahead...
