## English (Meaning Translation)

**Blessing**

That you have decided to write the biography of your father, Bhai Hira Singh Ji, is highly commendable. This biography is of such a revered Gursikh, whose life will provide light to every Sikh. Such a guileless servant, a perfect Gursikh, a Kirtan performer of the highest caliber, free from greed, attachment, and ego, is rarely found.

Waheguru sends such noble souls only occasionally through His grace for the benefit of common people, who leave their stamp, which continues to show its effect forever.

The immense effort you have put in and all the material you have collected is also a favor to the Panth. Spending so much, undertaking so many tours, and gathering all this from various places—this is your great labor and an act of benevolence for the Panth. By reading this biography, Sikhs will continue to benefit, and it will continue to provide light for them to lead their conduct as Gursikhs. I congratulate you.
