[Verse from Gurbani]:
*"Kabir data tarvar daya fal upkari jivant ||*
*Pankhi chale disavri birkha sufal falant ||"*
(Kabir, the generous person is like a tree that yields the fruit of compassion; their life is for the benefit of others. When birds [souls] fly away to foreign lands [die], the tree still bears fruitful fruit.) (SGGS Ang 1376)

He would often read this Salok and his eyes would fill up. He used to say, "Reaching Sri Amritsar, present this paper with the Salok and my Waja (harmonium) to Bhai Sahib Bhai Vir Singh Ji, and ask him to proclaim my final victory (*Fateh*) [i.e., pray for my liberation]."
His Waja and that paper with the Salok were delivered to Bhai Sahib Bhai Vir Singh Ji. After Bhai [Vir] Singh Ji departed for Gurpuri, it was given to Bhai Hira Singh Ji's children.

Two-three days before Bhai Hira Singh Ji departed for Gurpuri, he called his wife Srimati Prem Kaur to sit near him and spoke words of this nature: "Birth and death are under the command of the Giver. There is peace in accepting the Will (*Bhana*). Upon my death, remain connected to the Feet [of the Guru] and do not uproot this [connection] by weeping and wailing. Satguru has brought me to a solitary place at the final time, which was my strong desire. Do not disturb the relish of this solitude by crying. Do not pick my 'flowers' (bones/ashes) etc. [for pilgrimage]; this ritual is not in accordance with Gurmat. Immerse all the *Mangal* (remains) in any flow of water in a nearby river. There is no need to go to any pilgrimage site (Tirath). On the day of the Bhog, prepare Karah Parshad openly (in abundance) and ... keep my soul in your sanctuary (*Charan Sharan*)!"

**Final Glimpse:**
Bhai Sahib Bhai Sudh Singh Ji Ragi, who was sitting near Bhai Hira Singh Ji at the final moment listening to the recitation of Sukhmani Sahib, had published the account of Bhai Sahib's 'Final Glimpse' in the September 21, 1961 issue of *Khalsa Samachar*.
[Title/Heading unclear]:
"O Beloved Bhai Sahib Hira Singh Ji! You have..."

## Notes
- "ਫੁੱਲ" (Phul): Literally flowers, refers to the residual bones picked after cremation.
- "ਮੰਗਲ" (Mangal): Joy/auspiciousness, here used delightfully for the mortal remains/ashes, contrary to the usual mourning term 'Sok'.
- "ਅੰਤਮ ਝਾਕੀ" (Antim Jhaki): Final glimpse/scene.
