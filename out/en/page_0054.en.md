## English (Meaning Translation)

...In the Pandal (tent), the sermon of religious life is given in the name of Kalgidhar, Guru Nanak...
Someone singing - "Kalgidhar Aabe-Hayat Pilate Hain" (Kalgidhar makes us drink the water of life/Amrit) and on this everyone crying...
The report of the religious Diwan of **15th Conference** which was held at **Patiala** in **April 1924**, is found on page 61 of Golden Jubilee Book as follows:
"[Kirtan] was to happen, so Sangats attracted by the pull of sitting in front of Bhai Sahib, reached the Diwan place at 3:30 AM itself.
Recitation of Bani colored the Sangat in divine color and a state of absorption prevailed on all sides. Bhai Sahib in today's discourse emphasized on the topic of **'Untouchable Upliftment'** (Achhut Udhar) and started explanation based on this line - *"...Jis Nahi So Chun Kadhiai"* (The one who doesn't have [Him/Naam] is picked and thrown out?).
With very sweet tune, reciting Shabad himself first and making Sangats recite after him, he would make them absolutely focused. Sometimes for a few minutes he would make the whole audience close eyes and meditate on Waheguru...
On the occasion of **10th Conference** at **Lahore** in **April 1917**, when **Nawab Zulfiqar Ali** of **Malerkotla** reached the Pandal and **Sardar Harbans Singh** introduced them, the audience might have been surprised that how is he in this conference being a Muslim? Then Bhai Hira Singh Ji stood up and said: 'His ancestor **Sher Khan** had said to the Nawab [of Sirhind] -
[Persian/Urdu couplet about Sher Khan's protest against killing Sahibzadas]...
Guru Nanak Patshah's [grace] is before my eyes..."

## Notes
- "Achhut Udhar" refers to the movement for upliftment of untouchables/dalits.
- Nawab Sher Khan of Malerkotla famously raised the "Ha-Da-Naara" (Voice of Truth/Justice) against the bricking alive of younger Sahibzadas.
