...[we are] beggars of *"sharnai, kar daya naam pargaas"*. More soft than silk...
He nourishes, gives clothing and food. How much gratitude [we should feel] that he nourishes us...
Made [us] silkworms, which are reared in special ways.
O Waheguru! May we also remain united in Satsang *"jaise madhup makhira"* (like the bee and the honey). O Satguru! But never separate us. Gratitude, O Satguru, Satsang, gratitude, gratitude! In this birth, grant the company of Gurmukhs, give gratitude, let us do gratitude; we poor ones have nothing else, only the begging of your gratitude. Gratitude that You granted human birth, and then granted the fly of Guru Nanak's house (being a humble Bee of the Guru's hive), for which even gods long. O Giver! Keep us ever in gratitude for this priceless gift.

Chaudhry Ji used to tell that after saying these words, he became so absorbed again that he remained in the color (state) of gratitude for a long time. Such was his private personal life; he would drink the *ras* (essence) from solitude and contemplation and then serve it to the congregations.

Another incident of this same place, [narrated by] Sri Sant Nischal Singh Ji, Dera Santpura Yamuna Nagar:
In the summer of 1924, we (Sri Sant Ji) went to the mountains of Koh Mari (Murree) for a few days. Upon reaching the Gurdwara, we learned that Bhai Hira Singh Ji had been there for several days. The Bhog of the morning Diwan had already taken place, so we thought, let's go and meet him at his residence. When we reached there, we saw that the gentlemen of Bhai Sahib's Jatha group were sitting there, but he himself, Bhai Sahib, was not there. None of them could tell where he had gone, so we went out with the intention of taking a short stroll. After going some distance, [we heard] a voice coming [from somewhere], and we started moving in that direction. Descending the gorge, finally we reached a grove of bushes. We saw that Bhai Hira Singh Ji was sitting with a small harmonium, absorbed in Kirtan. He was singing the Shabad:

> *Nibh ki dhokh ||*
> *Mukaam ohi par janiai ja rahai lok ||*
> (SGGS Ang 64)

We had come from his back side, so he did not see us, and we sat down silently behind him. After completing this Shabad, he started two more Shabads:

> *Jis aasan ham baithe kete bais gaya. ||*
> (SGGS Ang 488)

> *Sahib samalaih panth nihalaih asa bhi othai jana. ||*
> (SGGS Ang 529 [Corrected to 529/579, Ang 579 actually])

After performing Kirtan for about an hour, Bhai Hira Singh Ji became silent...

## Notes
- "ਧੋਖ" (Dhokh): In Gurbani "Nibh ki dhokh" (deception/illusion of endurance).
- "ਮੁਕਾਮੁ ਓਹੀ ਏਕੁ ਹੈ ਨਾਨਕਾ ਸਚੁ ਬੁਗੋਇ" is the line, but here "Mukaam ohi par janiai..." is quoted. Text says Ang 64.
- "ਸਾਹਿਬੁ ਸਮਾਲਿ ਪੰਥੁ ਨਿਹਾਲਿ..." is on Ang 579 usually. Text says 529 (or 5279? OCR noise). Corrected to proper Ang reference where possible or left as is.
