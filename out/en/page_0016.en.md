## English (Meaning Translation)

...used to do. His demise happened in 1905 after living an age of about 80 years.

The disciple of Bhai Mahna Singh Ji was **Bhai Achhar Singh Ji**, who despite being blind (Netra-hin), was a scholar of high caliber. From his scholarship, one can guess the ability of Bhai Mahna Singh Ji, and also of his other disciples, among whom Bhai Hira Singh Ji was also included.

Bhai Achhar Singh Ji had built his separate abode in a 'Chubara' (room on the upper floor) at the end of the bazaar. And in this Dharamsala, the 'Dasam Granth' was also installed along with 'Sri Guru Granth Sahib'. Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji was as if memorized by heart to him. [If someone read wrong], he would say "Yes! Why are you making a mistake, O one with eyes?" He used to perform Katha of Dasam Granth also.

In the beginning, many students of Khalsa High School Faruka received education from Bhai Achhar Singh Ji to prepare for the Giani examination. At that time the course used to be quite difficult. It included parts of Suraj Prakash, Bhagat Bani, Hanuman Natak and Vidya Sagar etc., but after taking education from him, students used to pass with good marks.

Bhai Achhar Singh Ji used to perform very melodious Kirtan with Dilruba/Saranda. His demise happened in 1943 after living an age of about 90 years.

Apart from the above three Seva Panthis, there was also a Dharamsala of an Udasi Mahatma, **Baba Sadhu Sachiar** in Faruka. This was famous as 'Baddi Dharamsala' (Big Dharamsala), perhaps because its Barandari and courtyard were quite spacious. Baba Ji's name was Sadhu Ram, but due to his words being true, he was popular as 'Sadhu Sachiar' (Truthful). It is said that he had come from the West with some disciples and settled here. Some time later, when Maharaja Ranjit Singh passed through the route of Faruka, Sahiwal on a campaign, he was extremely pleased to have Darshan of Baba Ji and listen to his Bachan (words). Maharaja Sahib [got a well dug] and his servants used to produce grain by farming for those coming and going to the Dharamsala. Until the beginning of the twentieth century, we have seen this well running ourselves.

Among the special devotees of Baba Sadhu Sachiar were gentlemen of Batra lineage, who took up the responsibility of service and maintenance of this abode after Baba Ji and [continued] the flow of Naam-Bani.
