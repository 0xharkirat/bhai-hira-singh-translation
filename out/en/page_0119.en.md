## English (Meaning Translation)

...Bhai Sahib had controlled such a huge mass of people... neither with stick nor with army, influence of Bhai Sahib's personality was far greater than these two.

**Dr. Karam Chand Ji's letter (Continued):**
...Government was afraid to give permission, but it was got. Police arrangements were excessive. Nagar Kirtan started. Bhai Sahib Bhai Hira Singh Ji had also come.
At **Fatehpuri**, which is stronghold of Muslims, he stood on a high place and delivered a speech. Among listeners were Hindus and Muslims in large numbers. I don't know what magic was in his tongue, everyone cried out 'Ash Ash' (Bravo/Wonderful) and started weeping.
I remember some words of Bhai Sahib, "O servants of my Allah! My Khuda Ram... How can servants of Allah kill any servant of Allah?... Allah, Ram, Rahim are same, all are His names..."
Then he sang with great heart:
*Hindud Turk Duja Rafji Imam Safi...*
(Hindu, Turk... Imam Safi...)
*Ek Hi Ki Sev Sabh Hi Ko Gurdev Ek...*
(Service of One, Gurdev of all is One...)
*Ghat Ghat Ke Antar Ki Janat...*
*Namasthan*...
(Guru Gobind Singh's Bani)
Sikhs were singing this Shabad with such fervor and even Muslims were also singing along... Muslims were saying, 'Wah! He is not Bhai Sahib, he is some Angel of Allah.'
It seemed that Bhai Sahib is doing magic...
God was speaking...
*Hau Apoh Bol Na Janda Mai Kahia Sabh Hukamao Jiyo ||*
(I do not know how to speak myself; I have spoken everything as per His Command.)

**Influence of Kirtan and Speech (concluded)**

## Notes
- **Delhi Nagar Kirtan**: In the Muslim stronghold of Fatehpuri, Bhai Hira Singh Ji preached unity of Allah and Ram during communal tension.
- His speech and shabad ("Hind Turk Duja...") captivated the Muslim crowd, who called him an "Angel of Allah".
- This averted potential conflict and created a spiritual atmosphere.
