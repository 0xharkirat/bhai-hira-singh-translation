## English (Meaning Translation)

...used to try fully to [promote Khalsa Samachar] and during his tours... used to make effort to make maximum subscribers.
**(Gur Pratap) Suraj Parkash:**
Authored by **Bhai Santokh Singh Ji**, whose Katha (discourse) used to be held in Gurdwaras... in old times.
...[When editing/printing of Suraj Prakash] was accepted by **Bhai Vir Singh Ji**, then Bhai Hira Singh Ji started doing powerful propaganda for it and received hundreds of advance orders because this was a very big project. In this regard, Sri Bhai Sahib Ji has written in the preface of **Sri Gur Pratap Suraj Granth** on page 3:
"The dictionary/commentary of Sri Guru Granth Sahib became complete in about 7 years. Then this thought arose that... should be prepared and printed and plan should be made that first this matter be published. If some gentlemen become desirous of taking the Granth then work should be started. In those days famous **Bhai Hira Singh Ji Ragi** was staying with us. Learning about our this resolution, Bhai Hira Singh Ji became happy and said that indeed many difficulties are faced while contemplating this Granth, if footnotes/meanings are added then it will become easy. Bhai Sahib (Hira Singh Ji) himself used to contemplate this Granth then.
After some days he went out and upon returning said that 'I mentioned about your proposed annotated Suraj Prakash outside, people became happy with this idea but want that difficult matters in this Granth should be opened (explained) and objection-able places and historical errors should also be corrected/reconciled, so that gentlemen of every view may start reading this Granth.' After some thought, the advice to do exactly this was confirmed."
In its footnote it is also written - 'Due to Bhai Sahib's effort, many people had agreed to take the Granth then only.'
Keeping... in view, this work was started soon and preparing its first written volume, it was sent to **Kasur** to Bhai Hira Singh Ji, so that seeing the start of this work he may be satisfied. This story is of **May 1926**.
How much yearning Bhai Hira Singh Ji had for preparation of this Granth and its preaching, can be estimated from... which is found written in **Khalsa Samachar 28 May 1926**:
"...In few days only the proof-reading, correction... of Gur Pratap Suraj Granth... which Bhai Vir Singh Ji had started due to supreme keen desire of Bhai Hira Singh Ji, was going on... I received. I read it daily for one hour..."
