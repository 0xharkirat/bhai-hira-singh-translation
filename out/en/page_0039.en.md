## English (Meaning Translation)

**Gurmat Preaching and Amrit Prachar**
Listeners of Bhai Hira Singh Ji's Kirtan often used to say that... he used to bind them such that the whole Sangat seemed 'mesmerized'.
...When I read an article published after his passing [in] **'Khalsa Advocate' 18.9.1926**, these lines of that article drew my attention...:
"We remember those words which an Arya [Samaji] said to his companion in Sindh - 'Come quickly after listening to Bhai Sahib's Kirtan, no need to listen to the explanation (Vyakhiya), because I have heard that he fills some such magic in his speech that heart gets tempted to become a Sikh and thus many people of other religions abandon their previous faith.'"

I kept thinking about this for a long time, 'Did he really have such magic?' Then I read somewhere else, 'Bhai Hira Singh Ji's speech had the effect of magic.' And then more that 'The effect of his magic-speech was such that atheists used to become believers.' All these things were somewhat surprising, and I kept reflecting on this for long.

Once I mentioned this 'magic-speech' to **Respected Bhai Sahel Singh Ji Chawla** (1903-2001). He was a great lover of Guru's house and practitioner of Naam. He immediately narrated an eye-witness scene to me which he had seen at the time of Amrit Prachar held at a religious Diwan in Faruka; he was also a student there at that time. It is as follows:

[A student] came with a cleaner shave than before. On being asked by companions he said, "Today Bhai Sahib Ji has to inspire for Amrit Prachar and I have got shaved properly so that I don't get trapped in this loop." But when he wore the dress and came out in the form of procession, that very student, wearing a beautiful turban and Kirpan, was included in that Jatha. On asking he told, "There was some such magic effect in Bhai Hira Singh Ji's speech that I could not remain without the gift of Amrit. I was explained a lot that I am Sehajdhari yet..."

- Corrected likely OCR word: "ਮਿਸਮਿਰਾਈਜ਼" -> "Mesmerized".
- Corrected likely OCR word: "ਹਜਾਮਤ" -> "Hajaamat" (Shave).
