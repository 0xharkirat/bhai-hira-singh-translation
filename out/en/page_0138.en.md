Bhai Hira Singh Ji's life was a life of hard labor (*Ghali*). Often, he would sit up at 2:30 AM. After the completion of Asa Di Var, many times he would also perform the Katha of Gur-Shabad, and often it would be 1 PM by the time the Diwan concluded. Then the evening Diwan would be set, which would conclude at 8-9 PM. Due to the opening of Ashrams in various places, local needs had increased, which led to an increase in Diwan congregations; and Bhai Hira Singh Ji's presence at every Diwan congregation was considered necessary and beneficial. Appeals for financial needs were made through Bhai Hira Singh Ji.
Because of this, as evident from his diaries, many times if a Diwan concluded at one place in the evening, to obey the command of the Sangat, he would travel all night to set the Diwan at another place the next morning.
This life full of hard labor continued continuously for 25-26 years, which his body could not endure, and he became diseased. He developed cancer in the intestines, which was discovered in 1924, but he continued to reach congregations obeying the command of the Sangats. Finally, in 1925, he became very weak. Regarding his trouble... [he] endured it only because he could not turn his face away from the command of the Sangats.

**Service and Simran in Sri Amritsar:**
In April 1925, he sent his eldest son Sardar Jagjit Singh to England (*Vilayat*) for education and he himself came and stayed at Sri Amritsar Ji. The family was already at Firuka. Here, [he kept] utter poverty in the house... kept his nephew Kaka Dhanna Singh with him. Dhanna Singh was from the progeny of Bapu Ji's uncle. His father Bhai Sher Singh had passed away at a young age. There was extreme poverty in the home. Therefore, Bhai... had called him to stay with him and put him in school. Along with this, he started his training in playing the Tabla (Jori) at the Vididala of Bhai Sai Ditta.
...prepared him for Kirtan. This child served Bhai Sahib personally day and night...
