...[Thank You Note]

O Guru Panth created and blessed by the Satguru,
Sri Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh.
O Poor-Cherishing Sadh Sangat Ji.

*"Hum naahi changay bura naahi koey"* (I am not good, no one is bad)
*"Satgur sangi keray raakho aapay"* (Satguru is my protector, He Himself keeps me)

...According to [Custom/Sikhi?], the words that you [sent] for your humble servant...
...Following the Great Word (Mahavak) ... it is difficult to write a reply to everyone today...
...We are extremely thankful to the Sangats, Akali Jathas and Singh Sabhas etc. ...
...and hope that Guru Panth will always keep its protecting hand on our heads.

We are the servants of Guru Panth,

Bhag Singh Ragi (Father),
Gurmukh Singh,
Pradhan Singh (Brothers),
**Prem Kaur (Wife) and Children**

## Notes
- This is a Thank You note from the family acknowledging condolences.
- **Discrepancy:** It lists "Prem Kaur (Supatni)" as a signatory. Earlier text (Page 134) mentioned Srimati Prem Kaur Ji passed away. It is possible this is an error in the original text, or there is a confusion of names/dates, or perhaps she passed away *after* this note (though Page 134 seemed to imply she died before him). Alternatively, this page (163) might be from an earlier event, but the context suggests condolences for Bhai Hira Singh.
- Given the explicit list, I've translated it as written.
