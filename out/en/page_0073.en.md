## English (Meaning Translation)

[Context: Likely referring to a program in Arya Samaj Mandir where initially they refused something, perhaps Parkash of Guru Granth Sahib]
...refused. The Sindhi Seth pleaded a lot but he didn't agree. On this side [the time was passing?], so he became very worried. Finally he offered his resignation. On this the Babu of the Samaj got worried because that Sindhi Seth used to do limitless financial service to the Samaj.
Therefore they agreed to do Parkash of Guru Baba and Bhai Sahib's divine Kirtan happened in the presence of **Sri Guru Granth Sahib** in **Arya Samaj Mandir**. He explained the importance of Guru Granth Sahib being the 'Eternal Guru' and the love of Guru's court was overflowing through the eyes of listeners. From everyone's mouth the holy tune of **'Dhan Guru Gobind Singh Ji'** was coming out.

This was a unique event in itself - going to the religious temple of another faith, preaching one's own faith and then convincing them. Sikh Sangats celebrated endlessly on this, perhaps this was the first such occasion.

**Kirtan in Military Platoon:**
One Diwan was held in **Platoon Number 107**. The city Sangat also arrived in crowds from three miles distance. The arrangement of Diwan and decoration of Pandal by Singhs of the Platoon was worth seeing. The Secretary of the Commanding Officer of the Platoon, **Sardar Sewa Singh Ji** was translating to him side by side. The Commanding Officer was so happy that at the end of Kirtan he said, "In future, whichever Jawans want to go to the weekly Diwan of Singh Sabha on Sunday, can go without any restriction. I will happily grant leave." Remember that in those days **Akali Movement** was in full swing in Punjab and British officers used to be afraid of such Diwans.

*Jithe Jai Bahai Mera Satguru So Than Suhava Ram Raje ||*
(Wherever my True Guru goes and sits, that place becomes beautiful, O Lord King.)
(Guru Granth Sahib, Ang 450)

In the vast ground of **Sanatan Dharam Mandir**, doing Parkash of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji... [Bhai Sahib] expressed that our every pore is under debt of Satguru Ji. When Bhai Sahib narrated the martyrdom of **Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur**, 'Hind Di Chadar', everyone's eyes started flowing like streams. Then Bhai Sahib painted the picture of Waheguru's Court where lakhs of Brahmas, Bishnus, Maheshs are standing...

## Notes
- "Platoon Number 107" likely refers to 107th Pioneers.
