## English (Meaning Translation)

**Sweetness and Impact of Kirtan**

**Sardar Manmohan Singh Ji Kailash Wale** writes in **Khalsa Samachar (3 September 1959)**:
"Once it so happened that Bhai Hira Singh Ji had gone to **Peshawar** and this slave had also gone to Peshawar for some work. He used to perform Kirtan at **Bhai Biba Singh Gurdwara**. Attendance used to be around **ten thousand**. Lovers of Sangat used to leave their homes at 3 in the morning. On the way, people in streets used to light lanterns and lamps with love so that Sangat faces no trouble. Bhai Hira Singh Ji's melodious Kirtan had such attraction that however early you go, Sangat would be full. Bhai Sahib used to create such **Karuna Ras** (Pathos/Compassion) and such **Birha** (Separation pangs) that handkerchiefs of lovers used to get wet [with tears]. Same was the condition of whole Sangat."

**Sodhi Teja Singh Ji**, author of **'Gurmat Prakash'**, writes in **Khalsa Samachar of 28 August 1952**:
"It is matter of **1922-23**, Bhai Hira Singh Ji came to **Lahore** and due to very large courtyard of **Baoli Sahib, Dabbi Bazar**, organizers announced his Kirtan there. Writer came to know that Bhai Sahib will perform Asa Di Var Kirtan from 3 AM. With this news such happiness rose as if of some time of supreme bliss. Eating Prashada at night prepared to sleep early and husband-wife consulted to reach Baoli Sahib before 3 AM to occupy seat in front. These were last days of Assu (Sept-Oct), woke up and took bath and walked fast towards Baoli Sahib. On the way one-two milkmen and Halwais [said], 'But that is to be at 3 o' clock, it is just 11 o' clock yet.' I went inside and saw Gurdwara clock, indeed it was this time only. Then we sat there only on carpets right in front [of stage] and enjoyed Kirtan. Bhai Sahib's time..."

## Notes
- **Sardar Manmohan Singh Ji (Kailash Wale)** describes the massive attendance (10,000) and emotional impact of Kirtan in **Peshawar**.
- **Sodhi Teja Singh Ji** recounts an incident in **Lahore (1922-23)** where he and his wife arrived at 11 PM for a 3 AM Kirtan, mistaking the time in excitement.
