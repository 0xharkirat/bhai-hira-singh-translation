## English (Meaning Translation)

'...send him to me for some days. If he comes, then continuous rain of Naam-Bani will start and my soul bathing in that pure shower will keep flying in higher realms.'
Bhai Sahib left saying 'Very Good' and reaching Amritsar wrote a postcard to Bhai Sudh Singh Ji, 'Bhai Hira Singh Ji desires that you go and stay with him for some days and read Naam-Bani together, do Satsang. His body is unwell and he is getting treatment.'
A few days after this, Bhai Sudh Singh Ji reached Bhai Hira Singh Ji, by then he had moved from **Lahore** to **Kasur**.

Second time **Bhai Sahib Bhai Vir Singh Ji** came to visit **Kasur Hospital**...
He sat on the chair and looking at the effect of the room said, 'Bhai Hira Singh Ji! This room does not look like a sick-room at all; here the fragrance of Gurbani is permeating in the atmosphere.' Bhai Hira Singh Ji with tearful eyes said, 'It is [result of] your blessings and Doctor Sahib's kindness.'
Respected Bhai Sahib Ji then started natural spiritual discourse and said to Bhai Hira Singh Ji, 'Bhai Sahib! To conclude from bodily pain that the deeds of the being are not good, is not correct. All are not good, all are not bad. A thief and tyrant who commits theft and tyranny all his life, when suddenly police raids and catches him or shoot him dead, will that man dying instantly be considered good?'
'...knows, for us the Satguru's order is *"Jab Lag Jivah Kali Kal Meh, Jan Nanak Naam Sambhar"*. Pain and pleasure are all His command.'
*Hey Gobind Hey Gopal Hey Dayal Lal...*
*Arogam Maha Rogam Bismrite Karuna Mayah ||*
(To forget the Compassionate One is the greatest disease; remembering Him is health.)
(Guru Granth Sahib, Ang 1326)

'...is, but if one is healthy, distinct, but forgetting the Ocean of Grace Sri Waheguru Ji, he is a great patient. Thus Satguru Ji has [done kindness?] on the one doing Simran...
...why not suffering... so now do Simran more than before...'
With these words Bhai Hira Singh Ji forgot his pain and his consciousness got fixed in Naam. And then till his last time, Bhai Sahib Ji and Bhai Hira Singh Ji kept exchanging letters and sending messages...

## Notes
- Deep spiritual philosophy discussed between Bhai Vir Singh and Bhai Hira Singh regarding suffering and disease.
- Bhai Vir Singh emphasizes that physical pain doesn't imply bad karma; forgetting God is the real disease.
