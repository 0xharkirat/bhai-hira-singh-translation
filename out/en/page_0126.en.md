...perform Kirtan, and in the evening start the discourse (Katha) of *Suraj Prakash* in the courtyard.
Male and female friends would take benefit from the Kirtan. On the tenth day, after Bhog...
[Referring to wife's ashes]: Not only were the bones (flowers) picked, but everything including ashes was collected and sent to be immersed in the nearby river Jhelum.

And for himself, he left strict instructions: "Perform my last rites purely according to Gurmat." He emphasized two things: One, no weeping and wailing. [Second, everything] (including ashes) should be collected and immersed in a nearby river. So when he departed for the Guru's abode in September 1926, his ashes were not picked (separately) according to his wish...

He respected Kesh (unshorn hair) completely. He kept a small turban tied on his head at all times. He would not eat anything with a bare head. After combing, he would collect the fallen hair and immerse them in water. *Kesi ishnan* (washing hair/head): He would say "making the hair green (fresh)", he never said "drying hair".

**Faith in Ardas:** He had so much faith in the Ardas performed in the presence of Sri Guru Granth Sahib that before starting the smallest task, he would take the support of Sri Waheguru Ji and would only start work after performing Ardas.
With this, the minds of the listeners were also drawn to the Guru's feet. When he had to travel out, he would first perform Ardas and then depart. Before eating food, he would recite a Shabad of supplication and afterwards, as gratitude, recite the Shabad *"Devanhar datar kit mukh salahiai"*, and after reciting *"Deg Teg Fateh Nusrat Bedrang Yaft Az Nanak Guru Gobind Singh"*, he would perform the Ardas of gratitude. This was his perpetual routine, whether eating out somewhere or sitting in his own kitchen.

## Notes
- "ਕੇਸ ਹਰੇ ਕਰਦੇ ਸਨ" (Kes hare karde san): Literally "making hair green" (fresh/alive), a respectful term for washing hair in Sikh tradition, avoiding "drying" or "washing" which might imply burden.
- "ਚਾਲੇ ਪਾਉਣੇ" (Chale paune): To depart/start a journey.
