...[How did] such power come into a Ragi? The sacrifice to this extent...
...This was the glory of Naam, the earning of which Bhai Hira Singh did, and along with it...
...the fruit of that true yearning which he himself used to have to become a Gursikh...
This is the lesson, this is the teaching that... to the Gursikhs and virtuous people...
...on the day of the 25th anniversary of Bhai Hira Singh Ji, from his life...
This is the secret of his success.
This is the diamond particle (Hira Kani) of his life, which shines in the Panth till now.

...Bhai Hira Singh Ji had a passion for preaching Bani. This preaching was also the means of his livelihood. But preaching was the main purpose for him, that is why...
[he was] such a successful preacher. Hearing his relish-filled Kirtan, not hundreds, but thousands were persuaded towards the feet of Guru Nanak Ji.

**Poem**
You filled the palanquin of Emperor Guru Nanak,
You came as a devotee/servant,
You learnt music from Bhai Mardana,
You, the singer of very beautiful Divine Kirtan,
You joined [people] with the Chariot of Truth...
You adorned [the path]...

## Notes
- "Doli": Palanquin.
- "Sania": Devotee/Servant? Or maybe "Sain" (Master's)?
