## English (Meaning Translation)

Although mention of Anand Karaj is found in history [during time of] **Sixth Patshah** [Guru] Hargobind...
Bibi Viro's Anand Karaj was performed in village **Jhabal**, but with passage of time Brahmanical rituals became prevalent again and in the time of **Maharaja Ranjit Singh Ji** due to special importance given to Brahmanical [priests], this tradition almost vanished.

Then after Sikh Raj, **Baba Darbara Singh Ji (1814-1870)**, who was the eldest son and successor of **Baba Dyal Ji (1783-1855)**, founder of **Nirankari Samparda**, performed Anand Vivah in an open Diwan according to Gur-Maryada in **March 1855** and preached this ritual in his Gurdwara at **Rawalpindi**, which started outside in Sangats also but opposition continued.

When with the effort of Singh Sabha servants, preaching of Gur-Maryada started, then citing it as illegal, obstacles were started. By raising lawsuits in courts, fatwas were issued declaring many Anand Vivahs as against the law.
To get rid of this difficulty, **Anand Marriage Act** was passed.
This Bill was first presented by **Tika Ripudaman Singh**, Yuvaraj of Nabha State, who was then a member of Viceroy's Council, on **30 October 1908**, and later reaching the same position in the Council, **Sardar Sundar Singh Majithia** got it passed on **22 October 1909**.

With the passing of this Act, legal difficulties reduced but opposition on social level continued for a long time.
...against Anand Karaj... preached. For example that "Sikhs should not do this..."
Due to such wrong propaganda and social opposition, even good Sikhs hesitated to perform Anand Karaj.

## Notes
- Corrected likely OCR word: "ਗੁਰੂ ਗੋਬਿੰਦ" -> "Hargobind" (Guru Hargobind - context of Bibi Viro).
- Corrected likely OCR word: "198" -> "1908" (Year of bill presentation).
