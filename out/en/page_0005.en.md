## English (Meaning Translation)

**Introduction**

By writing the life events of the late Bhai Sahib Bhai Hira Singh Ji, his [son] and my dear Major Balwant Singh has refreshed the memory of this humble servant of the Panth.

[I] have had ample opportunity to listen to and enjoy the precious Kirtan of Bhai Sahib. Reading this book, the whole scene has come before my eyes of how he used to cast a spell over the congregation through his Kirtan and speech. I have had opportunities to listen to many religious and political lectures in Punjabi. But the effect that was present in Bhai Hira Singh Ji's speech, I have not seen in anyone else till now. This was not just a miracle of his tongue, but rather the influence of Gurbani and Sikh History within his heart, of which he was a manifestation.

The new things I have learned in this book are regarding his childhood life. The toil of service (Seva) and remembrance (Simran) that he undertook from the very beginning, as a fruit of that, the same appeared before the congregations through his Kirtan and speech.

With its publication, the biography of that selfless servant has not only become his memorial, but there has also been a praiseworthy addition to the preaching history of the Panth. Many such significant events have come to light which can become a source of inspiration from the life of an ideal preacher. I [congratulate] this successful effort.
