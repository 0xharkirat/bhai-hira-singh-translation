## English (Meaning Translation)

...White turban, white scarf (dupatta) around the neck, and head tilted to one side; he [was] a symbol of humility and humbleness. Yes!
...There was immense passion for the preaching of Gursikhi and Gurbani, and the [field of] preaching was his... through his Kirtan and lectures, reaching the [corners] of the country to flourish the garden of Gursikhi - the great service that the True Guru took from Bhai Hira Singh Ji by His grace, it is hard to find its parallel.

Bhai Hira Singh Ji lived his whole life for others; every thought he had was for the welfare of others. Every step he took was for the welfare of others, and every effort and labor...

Bhai Hira Singh Ji's background was neither of any rich nor of any wealthy family, nor was his birthplace famous from any aspect. Born in an ordinary house in a very backward area, without any financial means, if he grew up to become famous in the Panth, and was so respected and loved, then there must be some such special quality in him which cannot be in ordinary men. Perhaps that is why upon his departure to the next world, the sincere Editor wrote in the main article of 'Khalsa Samachar': "Bhai Hira Singh Ji Ragi was among those special men who are not born always, rather special needs of the country and community give birth to them."
