## English (Meaning Translation)

...The cleverness of Brahmins had alienated the rich Sikhs of **Chakkri** from the Singh Sabhias.
...No one even offered water to Bhai Sahib. He spent the night at a serai nearby.

[Next day, in the Diwan]... **Sardar Jagat Singh Sawhney** of Chakkri also arrived. He was a prominent leader of the area. When Bhai Sahib challenged the self-respect of Sikhs regarding the insult of Singh Sabha, their religious pride woke up, and there was a stir among the Sikhs.
Whispers started among the sitting Sikhs. The Sangat regained its non-secular pride from Bhai Sahib's words, but Sardar Jagat Singh of Chakkri was totally won over by Bhai Sahib's words. He got up and expressed his desire to take Amrit and took a pledge to organize Amrit Prachar in his village Chakkri. (This account is based on an article by **Bhai Teja Singh M.A.** published in 'Khalsa Samachar' dated 25 March 1971).

This story is just a sample of Bhai Hira Singh Ji's Singh Sabha preaching.
News of many such other incidents are found, when in difficult and tough times...
Singh Sabha Movement and Chief Khalsa Diwan...
