## English (Meaning Translation)

...dispute arose and they filed a suit against Bhai Amar Singh Ji. The case went from lower courts to **High Court**. In papers their [Bhai Amar Singh's] side was weak and contest was tough.

(Guru Granth Sahib, Ang 631)
*Mere Har Jio Sabh Ko Terai Vas ||*
(My Dear Lord, everything is in Your control...)
(Guru Granth Sahib, Ang 736)
