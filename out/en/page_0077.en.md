## English (Meaning Translation)

**Preaching at Nankana Sahib:**
When **Chief Khalsa Diwan** was established in **1902**, it was felt that on the occasion of this huge fair [at Nankana Sahib], good preaching of Dharma can be done. Keeping this in view, it was decided to send one Preacher Jatha. The first Jatha was sent in **November 1903**. In this Jatha **Bhai Bhag Singh Hira Singh Ji** Ragi, **Bhai Amrik Singh Ji Chune Wale** and Diwan's Updeshak (Preacher) were included...
Gathering Sangat from **Amritsar, Tarn Taran** and **Gujranwala**, a Jatha for Amrit preaching [led by] Bhai Lal Singh...
**Bhai Amrik Singh Ji Chune Wale (1868-1943)** was a great lover of Guru's house and spirited gentleman. His lecture used to be argumentative and pulling for the audience. He was among the founders of the Diwan and every year reaching Nankana Sahib on this Gurpurab, he used to perform the service of Dharma Prachar and Amrit Prachar for a week. He was arrested for being a member of the first **Shiromani Committee** which was declared illegal, and served two and a half years of rigorous imprisonment in Mianwali Jail.

Under the management of Chief Khalsa Diwan, preachers were sent.
**Bhai Amrik Singh Chune Wale** used to arrive every year for service, and bringing Langar material etc. collected from **Lahore** was his responsibility. In Lahore collecting utensils etc. from **S. Mehar Singh Chawla** and flour ration etc. from **S. Harnam Singh Attewale** [was his duty].
With the caravan (Vaheer) there used to be a Palanquin (Palki) of **Sri Guru Granth Sahib** and wherever stops were made, morning Diwans were held there.
With the divine Kirtan of **Bhai Bhag Singh Hira Singh Ragi**, such a mood was set that it seemed as if *"Dhan Guru Nanak"* was echoing even from the Karir and Wan trees.

At **Nankana Sahib**, there wasn't much population then. The **Bar** (wild land) was not yet settled, everywhere there were only Wan and Karir trees. On every side of the old building of **Gurdwara Janam Asthan**, only Sadhus were visible. In the Tabia (service) of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji also, a long-haired (Jatadhari) Sadhu used to be established. Rababis used to do Kirtan and offerings were taken by Udasi Saint only.
At that time **Mahant Kishan Das** (mentioning before **Mahant Narain Das** of the Saka/Massacre) used to sit on a cushion (Gadela) in the presence of Guru Maharaj.

It was natural for **Chief Khalsa Diwan** to oppose such anti-Gurmat activities. On this, the Mahant banned holding Diwan at Janam Asthan. Sikh Sangats used to pay obeisance at Gurdwaras but Diwan could not be held...
To the extent that in **1906** when Chief Khalsa Diwan's Jatha in Katak [month]...

## Notes
- "Chune Wale" - likely his trade/business family name (Lime merchant).
