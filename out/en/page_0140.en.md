However it happened, [he was asked?] to definitely reach Bharatpur for two-four days. Upon this, he went there in December 1925. After a few days, the Sangat of Gwalior, insisting on a Diwan congregation, took him there. There, he met the Muslim Fakir Haji Muhammad Maskin, whom he brought along to Amritsar and had him offer a whisk (*Chaur*) of Sandalwood at Sri Darbar Sahib.
Here in Gwalior itself, the fame of his Kirtan reached the ears of the Maharaja of the State, Madho Ji Rao. The Maharaja had a desire to listen to Kirtan and he made a request through Bhai Bhagwan Singh Ji. Bhai Sahib said, "If you perform the Parkash of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, then this servant is present."

The Bani had such an effect on the Maharaja that a Gutka (prayer book) of Sukhmani Sahib in Hindi was ordered, from which he used to recite daily and would keep the Gutka with him even during travel.
