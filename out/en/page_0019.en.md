**Background**
We will start the mention of the father and grandfather of Bhai Hira Singh Ji from his Gurmukh beloved grandfather, **Bhai Jiwan Singh Ji**.

At the end of the Dharamsala street of Bhai Jeet Singh Ji, there was a small house where a Gurmukh hard-working Sikh used to live, whose auspicious name was Bhai Jiwan Singh. He was a famous gentleman in the area due to his Sikh character and Gurmat way of life.
To wake up in the last quarter of the night (early morning) and perform Nitnem and recitation of Sukhmani Sahib was his daily routine.
