**Discourse and Kirtan**
...
Bhai Hira Singh Ji... through his Sadhana (discipline)...
...
Becoming the best model of a Kirtaniya...
...
The standard he established, our head bows before it on its own. ...

**Bhai Hira Singh Ji (Ragi)**
*Baljit Kaur Tulsi,*
*'Amrit Kirtan', September 1989*

...Those who have enjoyed the relish of Bhai Sahib Ji's Kirtan, hearing the supernatural incidents of Bhai Sahib Ji's life from them, I get overwhelmed.
It comes to my mind that Bhai Sahib Ji, I could not meet you, could not enjoy the relish of your Kirtan. But I ask, Bhai Sahib Ji! Where are you today?

## Notes
- Baljit Kaur Tulsi expresses her longing to have heard him, based on the accounts of others.
