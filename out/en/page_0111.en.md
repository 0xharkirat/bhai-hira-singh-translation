## English (Meaning Translation)

[Kirtan was so attractive that] so many Sangat came to listen that in such huge courtyard of Gurdwara there was no place left to sit.

**Master Karam Singh Ji, former Joint Secretary Chief Khalsa Diwan**, states in **30.8.1951** issue of **Khalsa Samachar**:
"In **Peshawar** there was great influence of **Sanatan Dharmis**. When **Singh Sabha** newly started, some loving gentlemen took Bhai Hira Singh Ji to Peshawar for preaching. When he performed Kirtan on the roof of **Bhai Biba Singh [Gurdwara]**, many opponents threw stones.
[When Sangat got agitated], Bhai Sahib said, 'If people throw stones at berry tree, it gives berries; and if someone strikes a Sikh with stone, why should something not be received from there?' Coming in emotion he said, 'I am a humble Nanak-Leva Sikh, here Kirtan of Guru Nanak is being performed. My prayer to Guru Nanak Dev Ji is that He may bless these stone-throwers with seven... from Mardana's Rabab.'
Saying this he went into amazing color of Kirtan. It was Kirtan as if Divine [music]... Exegesis was such that it was Gur-Darshan. Such effect was cast that stone-throwers felt ashamed and got impressed by Kirtan.
Next day when he performed Kirtan, a Sikh named **Bhai Dittu Singh** who lived there [was present]. Covering himself with blanket he came and sat in upper gallery... and getting impressed by Kirtan... taking rupees from his pockets... threw handfuls [of money] three-four times... and said, 'Sacrificed on these feet...'"

[Another incident mentions]:
**S. Harnam Singh, Nayi Basti Kasur** writes in Khalsa Samachar of 30.8.1951...
[Someone] took a vow that from today I will absolutely not [consume] tobacco...
When friends said that this tobacco smoking instrument (Hookah)...
He replied that now I will not even touch it.
...became a Sikh... wondered that such effect on a foolish man...
