# Srimati Prem Kaur Ji
The name of Bhai Sahib Bhai Hira Singh Ji's wife was Srimati Prem Kaur. At the time of marriage, the age of both was almost the same. Her father, Bhai Duni Chand, thanks to Bhai Hira Singh Ji's preaching, on the occasion of a religious congregation (Diwan), took Amrit along with his two sons and 40-50 other relatives and became swarmed Singhs; his name was kept Bhai Amar Singh.

Srimati Prem Kaur Ji gave full cooperation in the Panthic services of her respected husband throughout her life. In the beginning, when Bhai Hira Singh Ji reached Sri Amritsar and started his life there, Srimati Ji used to perform the service of sweeping the Parikrama of Sri Darbar Sahib at Amrit Vela together with Bhai Sahib. Then when Bhai Sahib started participating in Panthic works, she had to look after the house and take care of children alone for long periods of time.

The time Bhai Sahib spent at Sri Amritsar, in his cottage at Chowk Karori, was mostly passed in [simran/service? - missing context, implied].
[Whenever Bhai Sahib] would keep [students/guests] at his home, the entire responsibility of their service would be on Srimati Ji.

At the time of Bhai Hira Singh Ji's departure for Guru's abode (death) in 1926, his eldest son was... and three children, aged 15, 6, and 3 years, and one daughter aged 9 years, were with Srimati Prem Kaur Ji. In those days, except for the support of Satguru, they had no other [support], but Srimati Ji did not waver; she spent much of her time reciting Gurbani.
Being near the Boarding House, during the recess, many boys would come to Mata Prem Kaur Ji with their food to drink Lassi (buttermilk), and they considered it their good fortune to clean the utensils with their own hands. She fulfilled this duty continuously with great love and devotion until the partition of the country in 1947. Even when [her sons], who later went far away due to their jobs, requested their mother to come with them, she would refuse saying, "If I go from here, then who will serve these children (students) who are away from their mothers?"
