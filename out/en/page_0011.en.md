## English (Meaning Translation)

**Preface**
(Second Edition)

...[The demand for the book] kept coming, so the order could not be fulfilled. Upon the insistence of some admirers, an effort was made to print the second edition. In this, some additions and many detailed [accounts have been included].
On the 25th death anniversary of Bhai Hira Singh Ji, two special issues of 'Khalsa Samachar' were published in 1951 and 1952. And since all this writing was by the contemporaries of Bhai Sahib, therefore their eye-witnessed events have been used in 'Amolak Hira'.

On 2 September 1976, Bhai Sahib's 50th death anniversary was observed at the Khalsa High School established by him in Faruka (now at Ambala Cantonment). On this occasion, 'Bhai Hira Singh Model School' was opened there, and scholarships were started in the big school in his name for students coming First and Second in Divinity in every class. For their permanent fund, money [was given] by Bhai Hira Singh Ji's family...

In November 1979, under the patronage of the late Sardar Hukam Singh Ji, former Speaker Lok Sabha, the Birth Centenary of Bhai Hira Singh Ji was celebrated with great devotion and enthusiasm by the Kendri Singh Sabha at Chandigarh. Here, thousands of Sangat from far and near attended. Special issues of 'Singh Sabha Patrika', 'Ajit', 'Akali Times', 'Punjabi Tribune', 'Khalsa Samachar' and 'Khalsa Advocate' were published.
Some selected articles and poems from these, and from those published after the 50th anniversary and birth centenary, have been given at the end of this book. Due to the compulsion of the book size becoming large, these articles have been printed in condensed form.
Except for one or two articles, all articles and poems are writings of Bhai Sahib's contemporaries.

250-R, Model Town,                            **Dass** (Servant/Humble),
1 December 1985                               [Balwant Singh]
