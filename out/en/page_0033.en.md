## English (Meaning Translation)

At that time the Singh Sabha movement was in full force and Bhai Sahib reached various places in religious Diwans and made efforts for the fulfillment of Panthic objectives. Many reports of Gurmat preaching regarding [Singh Sabha] efforts and Anand Karaj ceremonies conducted by him are found published in Panthic newspapers of that time. In many functions, Giani Thakur Singh Ji used to be with him.

Being a preacher, the mention of Bhai Hira Singh Ji's association with famous Panth-Sevaks of that time is noteworthy. With **Bhai Sahib Bhai Vir Singh Ji**, he had a relationship of Satsang, and along with him, Bhai Hira Singh Ji had the honor of serving the Panth together with **Sardar Sundar Singh Ji Majithia**, **Sardar Harbans Singh Attari**, and **Sardar Trilochan Singh Ji**.
Due to the passing away of **Professor Gurmukh Singh** of Oriental College Lahore, the prominent worker of Singh Sabha, in 1898 and **Giani Ditt Singh Ji** in 1901, the work of Khalsa Diwan Lahore slowed down. Therefore in 1902, a representative body of the Panth, **Chief Khalsa Diwan** was formed and its President **Bhai Sahib Bhai Arjan Singh Ji Bagrian** and Secretary **Sardar Sundar Singh Ji Majithia** were elected. The first congregation of this Diwan was held on 30 October 1902 at Malwai Bunga, Sri Darbar Sahib.
Bhai Hira Singh Ji participated in this congregation along with the founders of the Diwan. Then dedicating his services to the Diwan, he performed ceaseless service. In this regard, some words from the main article of **'Khalsa Samachar'** dated 9 September 1926 [are quoted]:

"Bhai Hira Singh Ji Ragi appeared in the field in the capacity of a General of the Sikh Panth, and just as by the order of Sher-e-Punjab Ranjit Singh, Sardar Hari Singh Nalwa... established the coin of bravery of Sikhs up to the walls of Kabul and Kandahar... and enhanced the glory of Khalsa, similarly Bhai Hira Singh Ji Ragi, preaching under the order of Chief Khalsa Diwan, in small towns of Punjab, Kashmir, Frontier Province, U.P., Sindh, Bengal, Assam and Burma, sounded such a lion's roar (Singh-Naad) of Sikhism that every door and wall echoed with the resonance of **'Satnam Sri Waheguru'**... added four moons (glory) to Sikhism..."

Bhai Sahib reached religious Diwans at various places and [made Sikhs firm] on religion, conducted Amrit Prachar and inspired Sikh youth towards Rehat-Behat (Sikh code of conduct). To make the life according to Gurmat... he stressed on abandoning rituals like carrying bones to Haridwar, Shradhs, Navratras, fasting, wedding by Bedi etc.
