## English (Meaning Translation)

**Ek Lakh Paintalis Hazar Baal**
**Kara Yeh Chaur,**
**Samjho Haji Maskin Dastkar Asal Chandan Ne Banaya,**
**Baag Ki Khidmat Mein Laya Gaya**
(This Chaur with one lakh forty-five thousand hairs, understand that artisan Haji Maskin made it from real Sandalwood, and it has been brought for service of the Garden [Guru's Court].)

This **'Chaur of Sandalwood'** was included in the Jalau (treasure display) of Sri Darbar Sahib and when on special days Jalau is decorated, Sangats have Darshan of this Chaur also.

**Note:**
1. The news of congregation at Akal Takht is based on article published in **'Gurdwara Gazette' July 1972** by **S. Ravel Singh Advocate Chandigarh**.
2. In **Tribune** newspaper issue of **7 January 1979**, mentioning the items of Jalau of Sri Harmandir Sahib, **S. Jitvesh Singh Maini** wrote that the Muslim Fakir who offered Chaur was from **Turkey**. This point is not correct, Haji Sahib was originally resident of **Lahore**, not of Turkey.
3. Similarly in **Gurdwara Gazette September 72**, **Dr. Mohan Singh Ji** wrote: 'He spoke something in Arabic or Turkish, which one of his companion translated and told.' This is also not correct. We can say from personal knowledge... that Haji Sahib stayed alone at Bhai Sahib's residence. There was no other companion with him. Secondly he could speak **Hindustani** and **Punjabi** very well.

## Notes
- Clarification on the origin of Haji Maskin (Lahore vs Turkey) and language skills.
