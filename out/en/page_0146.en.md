...[The glow] was shining on his face. [As if] the sun has risen? The light of the lamp, when dim... [then] a strange light began to appear. The tongue became engaged in Simran.
Asked to take milk, he took it happily. Upon asking about his condition, he said it is very good.
It was 10 o'clock and Bhai Sukhdial Singh, brother of Bebe Prem Kaur, came after taking food (Prashad), he was ready to go to Firuka on the train today, he said Fateh.
The postman came with letters, but without opening them, he put five-seven letters under his pillow and became alert in the thought of reading/listening to Bani with me. He said, "First do Paath, then we will see the letters." I recited Paath with peace... Jap Sahib and Swayyas had also been read, and he said, "Recite Sukhmani Sahib also." "Sat Bachan" - I started it, and upon reading the 11th Salok [or Ashtapadi?], he signaled.
I became silent, then he took out the mail from under his pillow. First, he read the letter of Bhai Sham Singh Ji that "we have reached Firuka". He heard [the letters] of all... including Gurbachan Kaur.
The third letter, I don't know whose it was, that his eyes turned. I took the letters from his hands. Saying "Dhan Guru Nanak, Dhan Guru Nanak", he called out to Bebe Prem Kaur, who was feeding Prashad to the children. She ran...
...And he became above speaking and hearing.
...Looked at [her] and said, "Prem Kaur! This time is the final moment, do not wail or mourn," and ordered me, "Continue the Paath you are doing clearly in the same way."
Now it was 12 o'clock, and exactly at 3 o'clock, he left the body (*Chola*) and went to his true home.

*Suraj kiran mile jal ka jal hua ram ||*
*Joti jot rali sampuran kia ram ||*
(As the ray of the sun blends with the sun and water becomes water again; The light blends with the Light, and the Primal Lord accomplishes all.) (SGGS Ang 846)

**Last Rites:**
The place where Bhai Sahib was staying was quite far up from Dehradun on Rajpur Road. At that time, the population nearby was very sparse. Partly due to this distance and isolation, and partly because the children were young and unacquainted, news could not be sent to the city... Even very few gentlemen knew about his arrival here. On that day...
