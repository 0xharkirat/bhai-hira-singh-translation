- S. Nanak Singh 'Sajan', Head Clerk, Sikh Education Committee,
*Khalsa* and *Khalsa Advocate* 19.9.1926

The Cuckoo (Koyal) has stopped cooing,
The deep flow of the river has stopped,
...
Life has become lifeless without you,
First, the 'Heap of Bhajan Pratap' (Glory of Devotion) was taken,
After that, 'Tej Pratap' (Glory of Splendor) also went away,
There was only one 'Hira' (Diamond) in the Treasury,
Oh! Cruel death has looted that too.
The greatest preacher of Guru's House,
Who had his fame in the whole of India,
Never spoke a bad word from his mouth,
Made stone hearts soft with his melodies,
Kept the organization of Panth established...

('Heap of Bhajan Pratap' - Sant Baba Sham Singh Ji, passed away a few days earlier in April 1926; 'Tej Pratap' - S. Teja Singh Samundri, whose martyrdom happened in July 1926 due to heart disease in jail).

## Notes
- "Koyal": Symbol of sweet voice.
- "Bhajan Pratap da Punj": Refers to Sant Baba Sham Singh.
- "Tej Pratap": Refers to S. Teja Singh Samundri using wordplay on his name 'Teja' (Splendor/Tej).
