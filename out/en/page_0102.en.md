## English (Meaning Translation)

'...Bhai Sudh Singh, who is filled with spirit of sacrifice... who has made only Panth Sewa the goal of his life... and who paying off Panthic Ashram's debt by mortgaging even his own house... has now gone to Burma. Now it is our duty to pay off Bank's debt and release his house.'
Bhai Hira Singh Ji's this appeal was in such appropriate and attractive words that it had deep effect on Sangat and Sangat collected money at that very time and paid to the Bank along with interest. Bhai Hira Singh Ji took back the deed of house, tore it into pieces and sent it by post to Bhai Sudh Singh Ji in **Burma**.
On receiving it, first he was surprised... but when he read Bhai Hira Singh Ji's letter, he came to know how all this happened...

**Reaching Kasur:**
During the days of Bhai Hira Singh Ji's illness, he [Bhai Sudh Singh] came to **Kasur** with his Jatha and stayed for full one month. All day beautiful atmosphere of Satsang remained through Gurbani, Gur-History and Kirtan. In morning Nitnem, recitation of Sukhmani Sahib and Bavan Akhri, and in afternoon Katha of Suraj Prakash. Friends coming to enquire health also benefited. In evening time Bhai Pardhan Singh Ji used to sing one or two Shabads...
After one month when Bhai Sudh Singh Ji was about to leave, Bhai Hira Singh Ji getting very emotional said, 'Bhai Sudh Singh Ji! The continuous recitations of Gurbani you have made me listen to, in what words should I thank you? ...words are few... Then he hugged Bhai Sudh Singh Ji and said, 'I have one strong desire, that at my last time you must be with me. Guru-Giver is on my head, is with me. You do Ardas that He may always dwell in my heart. I ask this from Giver, that you be with me at last moment and reciting Gurbani, you should send me to Guru's Country in the lap of Gurbani.' Saying this tears flowed from eyes of both brothers and Bhai Sudh Singh Ji saying Fateh departed for **Sargodha**. This story is of **May 1926**. The writer was present there in Bhai Sahib's service then.
After Bhai Hira Singh Ji, Bhai Sudh Singh Ji used to write something in his memory almost every year and get it published in **'Khalsa Samachar'**. He used to say, 'When month of **September** comes near, the memory of Bhai Hira Singh Ji swings in our heart...'
