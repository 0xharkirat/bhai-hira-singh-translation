...[Hiding?] self and... [shaking?] others,
Remaining humble but... making others drink the nectar of [Name?],
...
(Fragmented poem text)
Making [people] see the True Court (Darbar),
Doing Kirtan...
...
Singing the Name of Agam (Unfathomable) Creator,
That Truth molder...

## Notes
- Extremely fragmented poem text.
- Seems to be describing his humility and ability to connect people to the Divine.
