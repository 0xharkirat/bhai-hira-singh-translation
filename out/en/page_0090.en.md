## English (Meaning Translation)

...came. Upon asking he told that he is originally from Lahore, but for more than half a century he has lived in **Mecca and Medina**, where sitting he has prepared a precious 'Chaur'. He told that he was staying in **Gwalior**, [where] Bhai Sahib Hira Singh Ji also reached due to Diwan. He (Muslim Fakir) got the good fortune of listening to Bhai Sahib's Kirtan. Bhai Sahib's speech triggered such a vibration of **Guru Nanak's love** that he writhed like a wounded bird and thinking that to reach Guru Nanak's Court and offer the Chaur... such a high [personality is needed?]...
Reaching **Amritsar**, Haji Sahib stayed at Bhai Hira Singh Ji's residence for many days. (Haji Maskin is sitting with Bhai Sahib).
Here only on the top roof of Bhai Sahib's house, with the arrangement of **S. Gurbakhsh Singh Narang**, Editor **'Preetam'**, a group photo was taken which was published in 'Preetam' issue of **January 1926**, which is given here also.
During this time Bhai Sahib consulted officials of Sri Darbar Sahib Committee and made a program for a special congregation to offer the Chaur.
So on **31 December 1925**, a huge Diwan was held at **Sri Akal Takht**, in which after conclusion of Kirtan, Bhai Hira Singh Ji addressing the Sangats told -
"This Muslim Fakir who is with me, has traveled around the world. Now dyed in the supreme color of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, he has reached here. Working continuously for **five years and seven months** with love, he has prepared this Sandalwood Chaur, which has **one lakh forty-five thousand** strands like hair. These strands are prepared from **9 maunds 14 seers (approx 370 kg)** of Sandalwood. Haji Muhammad Maskin Ji has come to offer this Chaur to Sri Darbar Sahib."
...
[Another] Banarasi... of [different] faith...

## Notes
- The story of Haji Maskin offering the Sandalwood Chaur to Golden Temple via Bhai Hira Singh Ji is a famous example of inter-faith harmony.
- The weight of sandalwood used (9 maunds) is massive.
