## English (Meaning Translation)

4. Journey bare-footed from Sri Amritsar to Nankana Sahib. Ardas there...
5. **25,000 Rupees** for Martyrs' Memorial (this was later reduced to 10,000).

In presence of Sangat, Baba Ji accepted this decision and Jakaras were sounded. This story is of **23 May 1924**.
[Jatha/Sangat] started [journey]. Stopped for 20-22 days [on the way]. Wherever they stayed at night, Diwans were held.
...note printed in **15 November 1924**:
"On 4 November 1924, at about 3 o'clock Jatha reached. For 24 hours Baba Ji and family kept cleaning the floor. Seeing the places of Martyr Singhs, stream of tears started flowing from Baba Ji's eyes..."

Next day morning, a huge Diwan was held at Sri Janam Asthan, regarding which **Bhagat Puran Singh Ji** founder of Pingalwara (1904-1992) has described his eye-witness account which was printed in **Khalsa Samachar of 28 August 1952**:
"I got the opportunity to listen to Bhai Hira Singh Ji's Kirtan only once in 1924... when Baba Kartar Singh Ji Bedi, due to Panthic displeasure, reached Nankana Sahib traveling on foot with his Jatha. Diwan was going on, Bhai Hira Singh Ji was giving lecture on the life of Baba Kartar Singh's father, **Baba Khem Singh Ji**. Narrating the Sakhi of Baba Khem Singh Ji's love for Japji Sahib and Gursikhi, he was telling that Baba Ji had immense love for Gurbani, used to recite many Japji Sahib paths in a day... that too reciting each word distinctly with understanding and feeling the emotion.
Bhai Sahib's effective speech had such an effect that Baba Kartar Singh Ji's wife, getting into Vairag (dispassion), screaming/sobbing fell at the feet of Bhai Sahib in presence of Guru Baba Ji. On this incident, Ardas was performed and Baba Kartar Singh Ji's mistake was forgiven before Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji."

## Notes
- "Bhagat Puran Singh Ji" (Pingalwara) gives eye-witness account of the reconciliation diwan.
- The forgiving nature of Panth is highlighted.
