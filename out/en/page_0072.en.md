## English (Meaning Translation)

**Preaching Tours in Quetta (Balochistan)**
In **Quetta**, lovers like **Rai Bahadur Kabla Singh** and **Sardar Bahadur Gurdit Singh Ji** had established a center for Sikh preaching by forming **Sri Guru Singh Sabha**. A **Khalsa High School** was also running very successfully there, whose Headmaster **Late Giani Sadhu Singh Ji** was a great lover of Guru's house and an enthusiastic gentleman. He became a victim of the **Earthquake of 1935**.

For the month of **August 1920**, **Chief Khalsa Diwan** gave permission to Bhai Hira Singh Ji to go to Quetta and he reached there on **30th July**. On the first day a huge Procession and then for three days religious Diwan congregations were held. From 2 AM in the morning (Amrit Vela) Sangats started arriving and by 4 AM the whole Pandal was packed...
Besides Sangats, gentlemen of other faiths also joined and were satisfied by enjoying the holy Bani of Satguru.
To the extent that **Lat Sahib (Governor/Agent to Governor General) of Balochistan** served Langar and Chhabeels (sweet water stalls) at his Government House (Residency)...

(Khalsa Samachar 30 August 1951, From Quetta Preaching Tours, Written by **S. Kahan Singh Ji**, President Sri Guru Singh Sabha, Lodhi Road New Delhi)

## Notes
- "Lat Sahib" refers to the Agent to the Governor General (AGG) in Balochistan. The mention of him serving Langar is significant.
