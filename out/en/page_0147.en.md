From this side, when the gentlemen sent by Dr. Balbir Singh Ji reached the city to arrange the cremation, this shocking news reached the city residents. Then it spread like lightning and many gentlemen reached the cremation ground directly. Bhai Sudh Singh Ji sat under a shed and started a continuous stream (*Jhari*) of Vairag-filled Kirtan.
Around 8 o'clock, when the rain stopped, Ardas was performed and the body was consigned to flames.
[People regretted] that such a prominent Panthic figure lived in Dehradun for full 18 days and departed for Gurpuri, and we didn't even have news – if only we could have done some service. Actually, Bhai Hira [Singh Ji had kept it quiet?].
News was sent via telegram, which is found published in *Khalsa Samachar* dated September 2 [or 9?], 1926 as follows:
"Ha! Bhai Hira Singh Ji Ragi.
This news will be heard with great sorrow in the entire Panth that the zealous servant of the Panth, unique Ragi, exemplary preacher, taster of Naam Bani, hero of speech and deeds... was just about to go... that this shocking news reached Sri Amritsar."
With this, this sorrowful news reached every corner of the country.

On the morning of September 4, according to Bhai Sahib's wish, without picking flowers (bones) etc., [the remains were] immersed in water. Dr. Balbir Singh Ji and Rai Bahadur Ram Ratan Puri Ji...
...and sent them off from Dehradun station in a train.

**Bhog of Sehaj Path:**
On September 15, 1926, performing the Bhog of [Sehaj Path?] for Bhai Hira Singh Ji... [discussing?] the supremely holy Panthic service of Bhai Hira Singh Ji and this loss... kept raining tears [from eyes].
Then Sriman Sant Sangat Singh Ji, who had arrived in the morning...
In every discourse of his, he [recalled?] his Satsang associations with Bhai Hira Singh Ji...
[He was like a silkworm?] who, while weaving silk, ended himself [in the process].

## Notes
- "ਹਾ!" (Ha!): An expression of grief/alas.
- "Sehaj Path": Continuous reading of Guru Granth Sahib, but usually done intermittently over days, unlike Akhand Path.
