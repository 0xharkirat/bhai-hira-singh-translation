## English (Meaning Translation)

'...today sweet sweet Bhai Hira Singh, Guru's unique Kirtaniya is coming to memory... was very loving with everyone and truly he was a trader of virtues... recipient of Guru's grace and a great player in sphere of No-Enmity (Nirvair)... Waheguru Ji had blessed him with knowledge... On his tongue Saraswati resided and in speech-composition he was like a master. He used to bind thousands of listeners like beads in a rosary... and wonder was that for four-four hours he would not let anyone move. There was sweet juice in his oratory, it was some spiritual earning...'

**Sant Sangat Singh Ji Kamalie Wale (1882-1950):**
