Speech is cleverness, but in the Guru's house, action/practice is supreme. Only a preacher with a practical life can influence others. Bhai Hira Singh Ji's life was a practical life, a life of earnings (spiritual practice). [In him was Dharma].
He was inherently absorbed in Bani from within. He was a practitioner of "Sitting, standing, sleeping, [meditate on] Naam".
Oftentimes, his prayer at the Guru's door was always this:
> *Visar nahi datar apna naam dehu.*
> (SGGS Ang 762)

[Context: An incident] ... It was about 3 AM at night, I [woke up?] for you... He woke up after taking a bath...
Bhai Sahib sat at the feet of [Guru Ji?]...
With water, *garvi* (small pot), *datan* (neem stick)... sat down. Bapu Ji and companions prepared...

## Notes
- "ਮਾਤਮ ਰਸੁ" (Maatam ras): Corrected to "ਆਤਮ ਰਸੁ" (Aatam ras) based on Gurbani context (Ang 252).
- "ਰਲੀ ਦਾ ਚਤਰ ੈ" (Rali da chatar hai): Corrected to "ਗਲਾਂ ਦਾ ਚਤਰ ਹੈ" or "ਕਥਨੀ ਦਾ ਚਤਰ ਹੈ" (clever in speech) based on context "Guru ghar vich karni pardhan hai".
