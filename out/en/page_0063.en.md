## English (Meaning Translation)

[Sardar Lakhmi Singh continues]: "...which was longing for his glimpse, got cooled. Sunday he came and Kirtan started at 4 AM in school Gurdwara and I was the first one to be present. In young age itself that color of Kirtan climbed which shines till now."
In this school, apart from free education to a large number of orphan and destitute children, free Langar and books etc. were also provided.
In this regard a letter from a gentleman **Mr. Johar** was published in **'The Tribune'** of **17 August 1917** addressed to the Editor, which the same newspaper repeated in its '75 years ago' column on **17 August 1992**. For the interest of readers, the exact words of that letter are given below:

*The Tribune, 17 August 1917*
*To The Editor,*
*THE KHALSA HIGH SCHOOL FARUKA*
*Sir - It is doubtful whether even the Sikh public are aware of the existence of a high school in the Shahpur District, fed and nurtured by the sole energy and the spirit of service of Bhai Hira Singh Ragi...*
*...has added a new chapter to the history of the Sikh educational activities...*
*...not from wealthy treasuries... but he has managed to raise 50,000 rupees...*
**(Johar)**

About [the school] always good opinion continued to be published. As a sample, in the **1922-23 Report** it is recorded as follows:
"**Khalsa High School Faruka (Shahpur)**
This school is the result of the labor of Bhai Hira Singh Ji Ragi. School has its own building. Boarding House is very big. There is space for **170 students**. Nearby the school is **30 Bighas of land** which is cultivated. Along with it a **Dispensary** is built. **Gurdwara** is separate, where all boarders mark daily attendance and recite **Jaap Sahib** together. Every Sunday they perform **Asa Di Var** with Vaja-Jori (Harmonium-Tabla). There are **328 students**. Number of Hindu Muslim students is almost equal to Sikh students. Muslims also compete with Sikh students in reading Punjabi and memorizing Sakhis.
In this school there is arrangement to give **free education** up to Tenth class to **orphan children**. Till today **12 students** have passed Entrance (Matric) under this scheme and right now are earning their livelihood. The Committee has made arrangement for assistance of **30 such children**..."

## Notes
- "Vaja-Jori" means Harmonium and Tabla pair.
- "Jaap Sahib" is a morning prayer by Guru Gobind Singh Ji.
