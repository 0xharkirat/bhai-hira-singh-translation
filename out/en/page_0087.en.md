## English (Meaning Translation)

..."Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh" - the miracle of fulfilling the command of Sri Guru Kalgidhar Father, [this victory] was the blessing of that Gursikhi life living Ragi, Bhai Sahib Bhai Hira Singh Ji's words, deeds and life-discipline.

[Context: Baba Kartar Singh Bedi]
...**Baba Kartar Singh Bedi**, son of **Baba Khem Singh Ji Bedi**, had hand [in opposition], who was a companion in this evil deed of the Mahant.
Therefore, according to the Gurmata passed in the Saka Nankana Sahib, Panth issued orders to boycott Baba Ji. On this Baba Ji faced such humiliation, which cannot be experienced now. In those days, the ballad (Qissa) of 'Punjabi de Shahidi Sake' had reached hands of lakhs of people. In this there was a 'Siapa' (mourning dirge) titled:
*Haye Haye Ve Kartar Sonya*
*Jiondiyan Yi Moyion Ve Kartar Sonya*
(Alas, Alas, O Kartar Singh beautiful/gold; You are dead while living, O Kartar Singh.)

When hawkers used to recite this Siapa in streets and bazaars effectively, huge number of people used to gather.
...until he made efforts to seek forgiveness. Panth is always forgiving, so Panth decided to accept his request made with true heart. But before this Baba Ji was ordered to give a writing. Regarding this it is found printed in **Khalsa Samachar**... **1924** - Bedi Ji gave this writing...
After that **Panj Pyare** pronounced the following **Tankhah** (religious penance) on Baba Ji:
1. From... date for five days, cleaning Parikarma of Sri Darbar Sahib with broom.
2. Cleaning shoes of Sangats.
(On pleading... this was forgiven/modified).

## Notes
- "Baba Kartar Singh Bedi" was a descendant of Guru Nanak but opposed the Akali movement and supported Mahants/British. He was socially boycotted and later sought forgiveness.
