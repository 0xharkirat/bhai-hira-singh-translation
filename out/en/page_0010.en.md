## English (Meaning Translation)

[...kept] safe till today. Then upon coming to Yamuna Nagar... I met **Bhai Sant Singh Ji Khurana** (1877-1970) [who was from his village Faruka]... and had acquired the education of Gur-History from the top scholar of Gurmat **Bhai Mahna Singh Ji** (1815-1905) at the Dharamsala of Faruka.

Regarding Bhai Sahib's personal life, many events were learned from **Sri Sant Nishchal Singh Ji Maharaj** (1882-1978). Coincidentally, 4-5 days before Sant Ji passed away, when I went to see him, he patted my back as always and said, "Seeing you reminds us of Bhai Hira Singh." He narrated 4-5 incidents about Bhai Sahib. Naturally, at that time Giani Mohar Singh Ji Narang, Editor of 'Gur Sandesh' was also present there; he published all these events in the next issue of 'Gur Sandesh', October 1978.

Apart from this, whatever I could obtain by meeting Bhai Sahib's contemporaries and other friends or through correspondence, I have tried to present in this book. I am grateful to all such gentlemen who helped...
In this regard, I feel it necessary to make special mention of the late **Bhai Pradhan Singh Ji Ragi** (Jatha Bhai Sudh Singh Ji). When he [learned] about the book, he was so impressed that he started writing me letters repeatedly to publish the complete biography soon. Whenever he remembered an event, he used to write and send it to me. I also kept going to Delhi specially to meet him.
The last time when I went and showed him the complete manuscript in May 1979 and read out some parts to him, he was very pleased and said, "If this is printed and ready in my lifetime, I will be very happy." But alas! His wish could not be fulfilled and he departed for the Guru's Abode on 6-8-79.

In the preparation of this manuscript, my younger brother **Major Agyapal Singh**... Air Vice Marshal Manjit Singh, S. Manmohan Singh Chief Engineer, Major General Surjit Singh and Brigadier Surinder Singh gave me full cooperation.

In the end, I ask forgiveness from the readers for my errors.


220-R, Model Town                              **Balwant Singh Major**
Yamuna Nagar
2 September 1980

## Notes
- Corrected likely OCR word: "ਨਿੱਜ ਜੀਵਨ" -> "personal life".
- Top lines were fragmented, context inferred connection to sources (Sant Singh Khurana).
