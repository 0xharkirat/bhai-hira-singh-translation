## English (Meaning Translation)

"'...A great Priest Sahib has come from Punjab to our [place]. His [Kirtan/Sermon] takes place daily till 12 o'clock. All city judges and officers go to listen. If you allow, we may also hold his Kirtan in the Kothi here, so that you may also see...'"
Lat Sahib was a bit surprised at this unique request and after thinking a little... looked at Sardar Bahadur's intent face and said...
He called [someone] and asked who this Priest is? They told that he is a religious leader of very high stature.
On this Lat Sahib ordered that preparation for the next Diwan be done in his Lawn.
So next morning, Parkash of **Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji** was done in the Lawn of Lat Sahib's Kothi and Diwan was held in which **Bhai Bhag Singh Hira Singh Ji** performed captivating Kirtan and blessed thousands of Sangat.
Apart from Lat Sahib, all officers of his Residency, Government employees, Hindus, Sikhs, Muslims, Parsis, everyone sat for the full time and listened to Kirtan and enjoyed the bliss - *"Taha Baikunth Jah Kirtan Tera"* (There is heaven where Your Kirtan is performed).

Regarding the effect of this one month's preaching, some words from the report sent by **Rai Bahadur Kabla Singh**, President Sri Guru Singh Sabha Quetta to Chief Khalsa Diwan are as follows, which appeared in the supplement of **Khalsa Samachar dated 16 August 1920**:
"giving the swing/joy of Gurbani Kirtan to Sikh Sangat all day, Bhai Hira Singh Ji showed a glimpse of Baikunth Dham (Heaven) on this earth. The flow of Satsang and essence of Gursikhi - waking at late night (Amrit Vela), reading Gurbani etc. - was revived anew.
Shopkeepers and families sitting in homes discuss the morning Diwan all day... come to Bhai Sahib to understand Gursikhi...
Those who in earlier days used to sit with naked heads like strangers... today they rub their nose before Guru Granth Sahib and bow... and offering Karah Parshad get Ardas performed...
Many gentlemen took pledge that after 4 o'clock they will never stay [at shop/work] and will come to Gurdwara daily to do Satsang...
The Kirtans held in Arya Samaj and Sanatan Dharam Mandirs after Parkash of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji, their effect was worth seeing there itself..."
