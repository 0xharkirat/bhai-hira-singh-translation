## English (Meaning Translation)

[Duplicate content: The first half of this page text seems to be identical to Page 116, recounting the Sahiwal slanderer incident and Bhai Takhat Singh fundraising incident. I will translate the new content starting from bottom.]

**Eyewitness Account of Malik Hardit Singh Ji:**
About how Bhai Hira Singh Ji's words used to influence Sangat, **S. Hardit Singh Ji Malik I.C.S. and former Ambassador Government of India**, wrote an eyewitness account in answer to our query, Punjabi translation of which is recorded below:
"I have enjoyed the flavor of Bhai Sahib Hira Singh Ji's Kirtan many times...
Apart from being expert in music (Raag Vidya) and Gurbani, his great wealth was his high character, limitless dedication and extreme degree of humility.
Due to these qualities, such power had come in Bhai Sahib that when he used to perform Kirtan, he used to bind huge masses of Sangat in one focus.
I myself have seen a scene of his amazing power once. In **1923** at **Gurdwara Janam Asthan Sri Nankana Sahib**, perhaps it was Darbar of **Guru Nanak Dev Ji's Birthday**. In those days I was **Assistant Commissioner** of **Sheikhupura**. Since Nankana Sahib was in that district, I had attended that Darbar in capacity of official so that arrangements to keep complete peace in Gurpurb gathering remain successful..."

## Notes
- **S. Hardit Singh Malik (ICS, Ambassador)**: A prominent Sikh figure gives his testimony.
- **Nankana Sahib 1923**: Malik was Assistant Commissioner of Sheikhupura. He attended the massive Gurpurb gathering (approx 1 lakh people) for official duty.
