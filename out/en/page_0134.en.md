...
At the time of the partition of the country, Prem Kaur Ji had to leave her home out of compulsion and could bring nothing from the filled house except the clothes she was wearing. Then her support remained only her children and Naam Simran. In her final time, she was in Sri Amritsar, with her son [Trilochan/Sirlochan] Singh... [only] physical weakness.
On the final day, at noon, she told her son Trilochan Singh who was sitting near her, "Your father has come and is calling me, but I said it is very hot right now, I will come in the cool time (evening)."
A short while later, she told the children, "Go and distribute Rotis (bread) to the poor." Her command was obeyed immediately.
By then it was evening time. Mata Prem Kaur Ji herself recited the Paath of Rehras Sahib, then recited two Shabads which she used to recite very often - *"Gai bahorh bandi chhorh Nirankar dukhdari"* and *"Kot brahmand ko thakur swami sarab jia ka data re"*.
And then after reciting Japji Sahib twice, she closed her eyes forever. Thus, on 29th June 1967, about 41 years after her husband, enjoying a life of about [?] years, she went and rested in Guru's feet.
