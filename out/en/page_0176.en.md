[Poem snippet]
...Who brought the light of Truth to the world...
...

**Bhai Hira Singh Ragi**
I am very impressed by the personality of Bhai Sahib. He was a great scholar of the Panth, a selfless servant, detached from attachment and Maya! At [Ambala?] *Janambhoomi and Karambhoomi* of Sri Guru Nanak Dev Ji [sic - likely referring to a Gurdwara named such or a specific location], Bhai Sahib often used to do Kirtan and [take] the congregations to spiritual [mandal?] where there remains no difference between Man (Nar) and God (Narayan).
...
On this land colored in the holy color of... I have had the good fortune of [serving/listening] for about 17 [years?]...

## Notes
- The text seems cut off and slightly garbled ("Ambala" conjecture based on context of 'Abiba').
- Tribute praising his ability to merge the listener with the Divine.
