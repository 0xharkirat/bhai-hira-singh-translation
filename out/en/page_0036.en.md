## English (Meaning Translation)

...Apart from the annual sessions of Chief Khalsa Diwan, Diwans used to be held on occasions of Diwali and Vaisakhi. Sample reports of Diwans held in 1904...
"On the occasion of Diwali, Diwans were held on 5, 6, 7 November. [In the morning]... Ragis Bhai Partap Singh, Hira Singh performed Gurbani Kirtan... whole Sangat was extremely pleased..."
"...Asa Di Var was performed... Bhai Bhag Singh Hira Singh...
When Bhai Hira Singh Ji used to read 'Sir Ditiyan Je Mile Khasam' (If by giving head the Master is met) or 'Ram Simar Ram Simar Ihe Tero Kaj Hai' (Remember Ram, Remember Ram, this is your only work) in a very lovely tune, then everyone's mind used to get pulled..."

However, now the proposal of small effort of 'Chawani Fund' (Four Anna Fund) is before you for about three years, if you make it happen instead of just 'saying', then the boat will sail across.
What is the reason that even this small task has not reached full success? It was required that by today this task should have been remembered by every child, poor and rich in Sikhs..."

The purpose of describing the above sample incidents is to show how much attraction was there in Bhai Hira Singh Ji's heart for the progress of Chief Khalsa Diwan and how much yearning was in his heart for Sikh preaching, the banner of which was lifted by the founders of the Diwan in those days.

It would not be out of place to mention here that the founders of Singh Sabha movement and Chief Khalsa Diwan...

## Notes
- Corrected likely OCR word: "ਸਿਰ ਦਿੱਤਆ" -> "Sir Ditiyan" (By giving head).
- Corrected likely OCR word: "ਚੁਆਨੀ" -> "Chawani" (Four Annas - a quarter rupee).
