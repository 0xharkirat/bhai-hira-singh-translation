...[Hearing] the voice of the throat and the call of that musical chest, in every village, every house, every door...
...was needed, yes. Exactly at that time when the tone of this 'Naad Gurmati' (Sound of Guru's Wisdom)...
...was needed even more than [before], this Veena (string instrument) of 'Guru-Love String' has gone silent.
This hopelessness...

The loss is being felt by everyone and in sorrow over this loss...
Sitting in... singing a faint tune of sadness. It is true that [such individuals]...
...or art-skilled individuals are not made by making and are not produced [by effort].
They come, they are born, beyond human intellect. Yes.
But one human element is also there. The thing for which you will create a sphere/environment, the thing for which you will desire *Environment* meaning favorable materials, you will become a helper in the arrival and quick attainment of that thing.
[For them] to be perfect is not in your control, but you can create a helpful sphere for the assistance, favorability, and ... of such men, which sadly is visible that...
...in the present...
The span of that sphere among us is becoming narrower day by day.

Bhai Hira Singh was a ray of that dawn among us, which is rising as a new kind. He had religious emotion. He had a passion for Simran. He had an inner interest in Bani; there was a poetic level of experience in his understanding of the purport of Bani and the lives of Satgurus. Then along with Kirtan, there was the miracle of eloquence (*Fasahat*). There was blessing in his speech - a gift of the Master - but the signs of inner religious emotion showed the miracle of art-skill in his speech.

He has gone, the Master has called him. We have no power, we have to accept the Command. May the Master create and send more, this is our prayer. But the Satgurus had not made us helpless (like those with fallen minds relying on fate) in accepting the Command. We also have to do something. Yes!
What have we to do? We have to produce that sphere, that (*Environment*) favorable material, in which [people] like Bhai Hira Singh used to be born, nurtured, and attain perfection.

## Notes
- Continuation of Bhai Vir Singh's article. He argues that while such geniuses are born, the community must create an environment to nurture them.
- "Naad Gurmati": The sound/voice of Guru's wisdom.
