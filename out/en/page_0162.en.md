...and a copy of this [resolution] be sent to Bhai Sahib Ji's family.

*Note:* Drawing the attention of the contemporary officials of Chief Khalsa Diwan to this resolution and the warnings of Bhai Sahib Bhai Vir Singh Ji, it is requested [to note] that with the effort of [S. Harbans Singh?] Attari, 'Bhai Hira Singh Ragi Sangeet Vidyalaya' (Music School) was opened at Central Khalsa Orphanage on 8 September 1982 [1928?].
After that, 'Bhai Hira Singh Ragi Shiromani Rag Award' was started by the Dharm Prachar Committee, Chief Khalsa Diwan from the year 1989. In this award, a memento, a woolen shawl, and cash prize are given to the Best Ragi Singh of the year.
On behalf of Bhai Hira Singh Ji's family, with thanks, [we appreciate] both these Panthic works [done by] the Diwan...
...Shiromani Committee...
...That Akhand Paths dedicated to Bhai Hira Singh Ji be held at Gurdwaras of Tarn Taran Sahib, Sri Kesgarh Sahib, and Sri Punja Sahib.

**Condolence Resolution of Sri Guru Singh Sabha Firuka, Sargodha**
...expresses deep sorrow on the untimely passing away of ... Bhai Sahib's passing ... generally for the Panth and specifically for Singh Sabha Firuka, of which he was the soul, is such a shock that is very difficult to bear and constitutes such a loss...

## Notes
- Clarifies legacy: Music school (1982? possibly typo in original or OCR, maybe 1928?) and Award (1989).
- Condolence from his native village/town (Firuka).
