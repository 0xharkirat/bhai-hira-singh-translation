## English (Meaning Translation)

...were elected. But soon in **January 1921**, due to being elected as Member of Executive of Punjab Government [Minister?], **Sardar Sundar Singh Majithia** had to resign from this post.

**Keys Morcha and Establishment of Akali Dal:**
Although the Committee (SGPC) was formed, the keys were still kept with the [Government appointed] Manager (Sarbrah), on which **Chabiyan Da Morcha** (Keys Agitation) started. On **14 December 1920** **Akali Dal** was formed and the agitation intensified. Then after struggle of full one year, on **19 January 1922** keys were handed over to the Panth and this Morcha was won. On this **Mahatma Gandhi** sent a congratulatory telegram to **Sardar Kharak Singh**, who was then called the Uncrowned King of Panth, writing: *"First decisive battle for India's freedom won."*

In the meantime, on **20 February 1921**, the **Saka Nankana Sahib** (Martyrdom Massacre) had happened.
...[Could not bear]. Finally on 20 February 1921, under the leadership of **Sardar Lachhman Singh Dharowali**, a Jatha of about **200 Singhs** reached Gurdwara Janam Asthan Sri Nankana Sahib at Amrit Vela...
As soon as the Singhs of the Jatha sat inside Gurdwara Sahib, their massacre was started. Singhs were killed with bullets and cut with Chhavis (axes) and Gandasas. For this work Mahant had already positioned hired goons. Then many were burnt alive by pouring oil. Jatha remained completely peaceful and Singhs gave martyrdoms with smiling faces.
**Sardar Dalip Singh**, who was a good friend of the Mahant, when came to stop him from this atrocity and reason with him, outside Gurdwara Sahib itself, Mahant cooled him down (killed him) with his bullet. All this [happened under the nose of?] English Government...
Next day when... [news reached]. Endless Sangats started marching towards Janam Asthan...

## Notes
- "Chabiyan Da Morcha" was the first major victory of the Akali movement against the British Govt.
- Mahatma Gandhi's quote is famous: "First battle of India's freedom won..."
