## English (Meaning Translation)

...They understood that he is someone come for Sikh gathering... was reciting **Sukhmani Sahib**. That voice felt very sweet to these Muslim brothers. They thought that Snake has said nothing to God's man, so what fear do we have. They also, taking Allah's name, went and sat behind Bhai Sahib, but Bhai Sahib was intoxicated in his own color, he did not know [they were there]...
Whole Path [was heard] by those brothers...
Bhai Sahib came from there and started **Asa Di Var Kirtan** in the Diwan. Those two brothers, leaving the plough, went to village. Told everyone that some Man of God has come, in whose speech there is amazing taste. They brought many Muslim brothers to the Diwan and listened to whole Kirtan with love.
Bhai Sahib explained this Shabad in his Kirtan:
*Panj Nivaja Vakht Panj Panj Panja Naau ||*
*Pehla Sach Halal Dui Teeja Khair Khudai ||*
*Chauthi Niyat Ras Man Panjvi Sifat Sanai ||*
*Karni Kalama Akh Kai Ta Musalman Sadai ||*
(Guru Granth Sahib, Ang 141)
And narrated the story of **Nawab Daulat Khan** of Sultanpur Lodhi.
Those people were so pleased that after three days of Diwan ended, Bhai Sahib was made to stay there for **eight days more**. Muslims from whole area were called by beat of drum and all listened to Kirtan. The effect of this was that shortage of rain ended there...

**Second time in 1914**, again on insistence of those Muslims, Diwan congregation was held. The War was on and **CID** used to remain alert at all times! When Bhai Sahib got down at **Sohawa Station**, CID constables came behind him... fearing this Ragi might preach against Government. Bhai Sahib [sang Shabad]:
*Rajan Mah Tu Raja...*
(Among Kings You are the King...)
(Guru Granth Sahib, Ang 507)
And explained it in beautiful way. CID [men] were very impressed. They said to Numberdar, 'These are God-fearing men... read Allah Allah. They don't have any [political] thing.' Then Policemen went away bowing head to Bhai Sahib.

The above two stories were noted down for us by **Gurmukh Beloved Giani Thakur Singh (1883-1987)** on **22 October 1975**... In **1911** he himself had reached Padi Darveza taking Bhai Sahib to Diwan...

## Notes
- **Padi Darveza (continued)**: Muslim farmers Karamdad Khan and Niamat Ali were mesmerized by Bhai Sahib's Sukhmani Sahib recitation. They invited other Muslims, and Bhai Sahib stayed 8 extra days, preaching common spiritual values (true Muslim definition from Gurbani), which allegedly ended a drought.
- **1914 Incident**: CID followed Bhai Hira Singh due to wartime suspicion, but were won over by his purely spiritual message ("Rajan Mah Tu Raja").
