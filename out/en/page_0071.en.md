## English (Meaning Translation)

**Abbottabad Singh Sabha** was making considerable efforts to save Sikhi from this declension. **Sardar Lakhmi Singh**, **Sardar Gulab Singh**, **Malik Deva Singh** and **Sardar Narain Singh** (Father of Giani Bhupinder Singh, Ex-MP) were Granthis of Singh Sabha Gurdwara. This was the time of end of the second decade of 20th century.
On the strong request of **Sri Guru Singh Sabha Abbottabad**, the first month (July) [of the tour] was given to District Hazara. During this one month, Bhai Sahib traveled from Abbottabad to **Mansehra**, **Nathia Gali**, **Dunga Gali** and other small settlements like **Malach**, **Baffa**, covering miles of journey on foot, often getting drenched in rain, and sounded the conch of Guru Nanak.

**Malach** was the center of preaching gatherings of **Babu Sawan Singh**, where through his chosen hymns and verses, highlighting the importance of a living Guru, he was preaching hundreds of innocent Sikhs against the spirit of Gursikhi. The local sewadars felt a dire need to counter this. Keeping this in mind, organizers arranged a program of Bhai Hira Singh Ji's divine Kirtan in Malach.
Here huge Diwans were held, in which all settlements of the area - **Ankhoba, Makel, Nara, Satoura, Mori, Vadbain, Jaba, Dhanak, Karch, Murari, Kala Bagh** and **Nathia Gali** participated.
Here Bhai Sahib gave very effective explanations of great sentences like *"Bani Guru Guru Hai Bani"* (Bani is Guru, Guru is Bani) and *"Shabad Guru Surat Dhun Chela"*. On topics like *"Gur Ki Vast Hai?"* (What is Guru's commodity?), "True Guru Light is manifest Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji", "There is no other way to adopt Guru except taking Amrit" - he gave argumentative and effective speeches and threw light with such logic that the entire effect of Radha Soami preaching was nullified.
He turned back many gentlemen towards their deity **Sri Guru Granth Sahib**.

After doing effective Sikhi preaching in Galiyan (Hills), when he returned to Abbottabad, a special **Jor-Mela** (Congregation) was held in Singh Sabha Gurdwara. In this, upon persuasion of Lawyers who had attended the Diwan at Nathia Gali, besides Sikhs, **Hindu and Muslim officers** were specially invited. Such a beautiful impression was cast on these visiting gentlemen and they expressed so much love that on their request, it was decided to hold another such Jor-Mela so that those Hindu-Muslim officers and employees who could not come in the first Diwan could also come and take benefit. In this Diwan, apart from Sikh Sangats, officers and gentlemen of other faiths were extremely impressed listening to Kirtan and discourse of Divine Bani and took immense love of Satguru in their hearts.

All money received during this time, like always, kept being sent to **Chief Khalsa Diwan** through organizers.

**Note:** Above facts are written based on report sent by **Sant Jiwan Singh Ji Abbottabad**. This report is found published in **Khalsa Samachar dated 2.8.1920**.

## Notes
- "Babu Sawan Singh" refers to the second Satguru of Radha Soami Satsang Beas (Great Master). The text reflects the ideological clash between mainstream Sikhism (Guru Granth Sahib as Guru) and Radha Soami sect (Living Guru).
