But due to his high and pure life and the support of Naam Bani, his soul remained powerful and his consciousness alert till the end.
From the side of the Gurmukh-living Bhai Sahib Bhai Vir Singh Ji, spiritual sermons and support continued to be received. He himself gave Darshan for the second time, the mention of which has... [been made?].
From here itself, he sent a message through Bhai Pradhan Singh to Lahore to be recited in the Conference congregation to be held in May 1926. For one month, Bhai... Singh Ji also came and stayed with the Jatha, due to which a good atmosphere of Satsang remained built...
