Regarding the influence of his speech, Bhai Teja Singh Kohli had written: "It is a fact that any person who heard Bhai Hira Singh Ji's Kirtan and exposition even once, would get up only after connecting their mind with Guru's Feet and Gurbani."

Bhai Hira Singh Ji had not acquired much worldly education, but in the words of Bhai Sahib Bhai Sudh Singh Ji, "Waheguru had given him Agam (Divine/Unfathomable) knowledge. Saraswati (Goddess of learning/speech) resided on his tongue and he was a master of speech composition. His exposition and subject-binding (*Mazboon-bandi*) were so vast that he would string thousands of listeners into one thread like beads of a rosary and bind them. And the wonder was that for three-three, four-four hours, he would not let anyone move. The sweet relish of his oratory and the philosophical order of his speech went with him; it is not found anywhere today. Yes, that sharp appeal that molded the listeners, the power that turned stone hearts and hard hearts soft like wax and butter—where is it today? It was some life, some spiritual earning (*Kamai*)."

And then, Bhai Sahib Bhai Vir Singh Ji had seen the signs of art-skill (*Kala-Kaushal*) in his speech. He wrote:
"Bhai Hira Singh was a ray of that dawn among us, which was rising as a new kind. He had religious emotion. He had a passion for Simran. He had an inner interest in Bani; there was a poetic level of experience in his understanding of the purport of Bani and the lives of Satgurus. Then along with Kirtan, there was the miracle of eloquence (*Fasahat*), there was blessing in his speech, a gift of the Master, but [it was all due to] the inner religious emotion..."

Professor Puran Singh Ji appeared to see Bhai Hira Singh like this:
*"Tu bhra bharia - manukh hona bara aukha hai,*
*Par tethon apana aap hilaia sara da..."*
(You brother... it is very difficult to be a human,
But you shook your entire self [and woke others?]...)

[Note: The poem text at the end is quite fragmented].
...No Panthic movement, educational, religious or reformative, was such that Bhai Hira Singh Ji did not participate in it with body, mind, and wealth to the maximum extent...
