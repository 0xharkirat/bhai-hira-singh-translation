**Bringing Sangat's Feet to the House:**
With the intention of bringing the feet of the Sangat (blessings) into his home, he held two Akhand Paths at home. Most of the time he sat and listened to the Path himself.
For four-five days, there was liveliness in the house, as if a Diwan itself had been set up. Others came. Kirtan was performed, but he remained sitting among the listeners. Upon the strong demand of the Sangat, he sang one Shabad and then addressed the Sangat with a few words.
A sentiment of compassion (*Karuna Ras*) spread throughout the entire Sangat. All the masters and students of the school were present; he spoke some words to them as usual, inspiring the children to maintain high character, love Bani, and partake Amrit. Emphasizing the study of history, he gave 25-30 copies of the book *Sri Kalgidhar Chamatkar*, which he had brought with him, to the school masters and children at half price. Finally, when he recited this [verse]:
*"Wadda tera darbar..."* (Your court is great...) (SGGS Ang 1376)
...then everyone's eyes became wet with tears.
