**Nankana**
*Singh Sabha Patrika*

...Two incidents of Bhai Hira Singh Ji's life are etched on my mind as if they happened yesterday. Bhai Sahib [was] in the fourth stage of life...
Guru Arjan Dev Ji's command:
*"Jis Pyare Sio Neho Tis Aage Mar Chaliye..."* (With whom you have love, die before him...)
*"Dhrog Jivan Sansar Ta Kai Pache Jiviye..."* (Cursed is the life in the world if one lives after him...)
...My father used to go to listen to Kirtan with other Satsangis...
...When [he] came to listen to Kirtan and exposition of Gur-Shabad...
...Even the flying birds would stop once, and seemed to be completely stopped by the melody and sweetness of the Shabad.

The second matter is also from my student days. [At] Sri Nankana Sahib [Jan 1921 / Feb 1921]...
On 20 February (10 Phagan) 1921, the terrible Saka occurred, in which Akali Singhs were taken inside by turns and martyred...
When the heart-rending scene of [yellow/pale?] bodies was being shown, at this time I and... went inside. At that time, Bhai Sahib Bhai Hira Singh was present there...
Before our eyes, Bhai Sahib placed the Bir of Sri Guru Granth Sahib, which was stained with the blood of Bhai Lachhman Singh, on his head...
and brought it from inside the Asthan (shrine) to the courtyard outside near the half-burnt bodies...
and recited the Hukamnama to the congregation weeping inside.

## Notes
- A powerful eyewitness account of the Nankana Sahib Massacre (1921).
- Bhai Hira Singh Ji's presence and act of carrying the blood-stained Bir is a significant historical detail.
