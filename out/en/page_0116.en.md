## English (Meaning Translation)

[Sahiwal Diwan Continued...]
...Two middle-aged gentlemen were sitting in the neighborhood. Both were [criticizing] Bhai Hira Singh Ji and abusing him rudely. I was very surprised that if they have so much hatred for Bhai Sahib in their hearts, then... why are they wasting their time sitting here.
Meanwhile, the time came. When he started narrating Sakhi... those two slanderers sitting near me started weeping and by turns getting up bowed to Bhai Hira Singh Ji and offered rupees. I saw them going like this three times. I said to myself, 'Wah!'...

**Effect of an Appeal:**
**Bhai Sudh Singh Ji** mentioning an untimely appeal made by Bhai Hira Singh Ji, wrote in **Khalsa Samachar issue of 30.8.1956** like this:
**Bhai Takhat Singh Ji** (who was pioneer of female education and was honored as **'Living Martyr'**) started performing Ardas... and all Sangat of Pandal stood up at their places, then I who was standing near Bhai Hira Singh Ji, from my mouth came out, 'Bhai Takhat Singh Ji has come from **Kanya Maha-Vidyala (Ferozepur)**, has brought such big Jatha of girls, will Conference people give them some help... that "Jat Aaye Tut Gaye" (came empty handed, went empty handed) will happen?'
He immediately caught my hand and came to the stage where Ardas was to happen... and when Ardas finished, Bhai Hira Singh Ji spoke, 'Beloved Guru Panth Khalsa Jio! The humble and selfless servant who has just performed Ardas, you know this Living Martyr... You know that Ashram is yours and worry of its expenses is also yours. Have you done any worry about them today?...'
I don't remember those words which he used in five-seven minutes... he made that Sangat stand... who had done Ardas and clearing pockets were about to leave for homes...
Within minutes **Seven Thousand Rupees** were collected for Kanya Maha-Vidyala.
...[People said] Blessed is Bhai Hira Singh Ji, blessed is your earning, and blessed is your mother...

## Notes
- **Sahiwal Miracle**: Two slanderers were transformed into devotees during the Diwan, weeping and making offerings.
- **Fundraising Miracle**: Bhai Hira Singh Ji made a spontaneous appeal after Ardas for **Bhai Takhat Singh's Kanya Maha-Vidyala**. He stopped the dispersing crowd and raised 7000 rupees in minutes.
