...[His] journey was an example of Sikhi...

**Departure of Sriman Bhai Hira Singh Ji Ragi**
*Main Article, 'Khalsa' and 'Khalsa Advocate', 18.9.1926*

The day of September 2 came as such an unfortunate day which, by putting an unfillable loss inside the Sikh Panth, spread a color of mourning. Wherever [any] dear one heard this sorrowful news of Bhai Hira [Singh], he flowed away in the river of grief. Why should it not be so? The toil that a person like you toiled, is it any small thing!
Thirty-thirty five years of your time has been spent for the preaching of Gursikhi. Hearing your supremely sweet exposition, even stone-hearted men used to become soft and become the bumblebees of Guru's Feet...
Some suitable memorial of the servant should be established...
Priceless Diamond...
