**S. Charan Singh Ji 'Nirmanu', Saharanpur,**
*'Khalsa Samachar' 28.8.195?*

No one can count the virtues [of him]...
[He was] the rain of the Cloud of Naam...
Meditator (Simran wala), ascetic of peace, and [carefree/joyous?]...
Embodiment of simplicity...
...
...
Servant of the Panth till the last breath; did [service] with body and mind...
Eyes yearn to see him, hearts are longing...
[If] Kirtan happens, Satsang comes [together], this is the prayer...

## Notes
- Poem by S. Charan Singh 'Nirmanu'.
