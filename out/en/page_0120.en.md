## English (Meaning Translation)

...No quarrel happened and Nagar Kirtan concluded without obstacle.
[When] movement ran, then in the hearts of Muslims too... Bhai Sahib also started Sikh preaching and Amrit Parchar.
In those days Bhai Hira Singh Ji was performing Asa Di Var Kirtan... at some place ...
In Kirtan explanation Bhai Sahib said:
"Khalsa Ji! Preaching of Sikhism is happening. You want and I also want that more and more people should come under Guru Gobind Singh's flag. But O beloveds of my Guru! O Rubies of Guru! Have we ever looked inside ourselves whether we are true Sikhs of Guru?"
There was such Juice (Ras) in his tongue and Kirtan that many gentlemen who did not even understand Punjabi, leave alone understanding Gurbani, they also used to come to listen to Kirtan.
**My one friend was Madrasi**, I asked him, 'Do you understand this?' He replied:
**"No, I don't understand what he sings or says, but his voice looks lovely because his voice is music."**
This was the Ras (Juice) in Bhai Sahib's tongue and speech - Raag Ras.

## Notes
- Conclusion of the Delhi incident.
- **Madrasi Friend's Testimony**: Even non-Punjabi speakers were mesmerized by Bhai Sahib's voice, calling it pure music despite the language barrier.
- Bhai Hira Singh's focus on internal introspection ("Are we true Sikhs?") alongside external preaching.
