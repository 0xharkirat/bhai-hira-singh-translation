**Such People Are Rare in the World**
*Bhai Sudh Singh Ji Ragi,*
*'Khalsa Samachar', 2.9.1976*

I had gone to Gujranwala in 1901. Doctor Maha Singh Ji had taken me from Jabbi saying that a Preacher's School (Updeshak School) is open [there], come and study something there. My age was 17-18 years. I went with great happiness, father gave permission. In Gujranwala, we stayed at the Samadh [of] S. Maha Singh. There Bhai Bhag Singh Hira Singh came...

Ashrams were needed at various places... due to which the emphasis on Diwan congregations increased...
And on this side, the Jatha also had the force of new youth. At every Diwan congregation, dates [for the next] would be fixed only with the consultation of Bhai [Sahib]...

**Kohinoor of the Panth: Bhai Sahib Hira Singh Ji**
*S. Jodh Singh, from special article 'Ajit', 2.9.1976*

...The consistency of speech and action in Bhai Hira Singh Ji's life made him famous as the 'Saint Kirtaniya' of his time, whose sight (Darshan) the congregations yearned for...
