...Nirankar (Formless) and Kartar (Creator)...

**Ah! 'Priceless Diamond' (Amolak Hira) of Khalsa Panth, the Darling of the Nation**
*Left the wound of separation forever*

- Giani Satnam Singh Ji, Editor 'Giani' Amritsar

...When the calamity of sufferings of Guru Ka Bagh etc. came upon the Sikh Nation, then Bhai Hira Singh Ji [used to praise] those righteous warriors with words like 'Ruby of Guru', 'Child of Sahib Kaur', 'Models of Faith' etc.
When he used to describe these warriors in a beautiful form in his Kirtan...
[Listeners] used to become emotional/restless. But by instilling his holy life to the account of the Guru, he has left an excellent memorial in the hearts of Sikhs.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji's Gurpurab was approaching...
[Sikhs] will search for him with their eyes...
...Bhai Hira Singh Ji Ragi was [one such person]... who [colored] his... in the will of the Guru.
