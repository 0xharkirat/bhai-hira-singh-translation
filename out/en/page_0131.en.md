...got the opportunity to attend the congregations together. Bhai Sahib would perform Kirtan and Sant Ji would do Katha. In his Kirtan, Bhai Sahib requested the congregation, "Sadh Sangat Ji! This Maya (money) that you bestow is your kindness, but please accept this request of this servant: please bestow this only at the conclusion of the Kirtan. It causes disturbance in the Kirtan and the concentration is broken. It is true that I am a householder and I have no other business/trade, but please enjoy the *ras* (essence) of Kirtan yourselves and let this servant also enjoy it for a moment."

Singh Sahib Giani Chet Singh Ji, former Head Granthi of Sri Darbar Sahib, in his speech while unveiling the portrait of Bhai Hira Singh Ji on 28th May 1972, said the following words:
"Where Bhai Hira Singh Ji's religious life was high, there Guru Maharaj had also blessed him with great patience and contentment. If he received an offering at some place, there was no special joy in his mind, and if he didn't receive it, there was no complaint... and then whatever offering came, he kept using it for Panthic Ashrams. He established Khalsa High School at a place like Firuka and whatever offering he received, he kept spending it on that school..."

Then the great thing is that whatever little amount he left for the education of his small children and the marriage of his daughter, he left a written order about it:
"When the boys grow up and start earning, they should donate this same amount to the Dharm-Arth (Charity) and Khalsa School Firuka. In this alone will be my happiness." And the children, honoring his wish, offered flowers (donations) according to his command.

**Secret of Success:**
The secret of Bhai Hira Singh Ji's success appears to be:
1. He was a man of practical life and earnings (spiritual practice).
2. He used to perform the Paath of Sri Guru Granth Sahib and Nitnem with full concentration.
3. He maintained regular study of Guru-Instruction and religious books.
4. He possessed the music of Gur-Shabad Kirtan.
5. He had made the supreme holy service of Guru Panth the main purpose of his life.

In an article, Sriman Bhai Sahib Bhai Vir Singh Ji, clarifying the secret of Bhai Hira Singh Ji's success, wrote in the issue of *Khalsa Samachar* dated 30.8.1951; some of his words are as follows:
"...The secret of his success and achievement lay in the fact that he was a Sikh of the Guru, in the true sense of these words. Many times at midnight, singing with one-and-a-half reeds (notes?) of the harmonium, he used to tell his own mind that at this time, my mind, meeting with the tune of the Shabad and the flow of emotion, will go to the feet of Waheguru and only Waheguru. This sincere effort of Bhai Hira Singh Ji, this heart-felt feeling, this yearning, was a quality that was rare. This is what made his value precious like the ruby of Salis Rai. That is why in almost all the High Schools that were built..."

## Notes
- "ਸਾਲਸ ਰਾਇ ਦੇ ਨਾਨ" (Salis Rai de nan?): Likely "Salis Rai de lal" (The ruby of Salis Rai Jeweller, a historical reference to a precious gem/devotee).
- "ਇੱਕ-ਡੇਢ" (Ik-dedh): One or one-and-a-half.
