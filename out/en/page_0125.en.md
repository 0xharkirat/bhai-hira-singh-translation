[UNCLEAR: Top lines are garbled]
...Muzaffarabad (now Pakistan).
...Gurdwara Koh Mari (Murree). At that time, Gurmukh Pyare S. Pradhan Singh Ji...
...His life was very high and spiritual...
...His bungalow was in a solitary place on the bank of the river...
...spent time with him. Bhai Pradhan Singh Ji describes in the 30.8.1951 issue of *Khalsa Samachar* how [it happened]:

One night, getting up at midnight, at the confluence of the two rivers (Jhelum and Krishna Ganga), sitting on a rock, Bhai Sahib started Kirtan:

> *Rat rate gal milah ank sahelrian ||*
> *[Man pai kahah suhalia samrath kant kiah]* ||
> (SGGS Ang 171? [Likely Ang 791: *Farida ratta rutt na ral*? Or Ang 171?])

[Having] the silence of the night, the sound of the flowing water, the confluence of two rivers, and then the flow towards the ocean, a wondrous *ras* (aesthetic experience) was built. Getting up from there at Amrit Vela, he came to the Gurdwara of the Sixth Patshahi and performed Kirtan.

Whenever he visited his town Firuka, in the evenings he would take a small harmonium and go out alone to a well or a sand dune, sitting alone doing Kirtan, becoming one with nature and singing the praises of Waheguru.

**Life according to Gurmat:**
Bhai Hira Singh Ji's entire life was according to Gurmat. He started every domestic task with the support of Guru Maharaj. Naming of children etc. and marriages were performed according to Guru-Maryada. But even when he had to admit his child to school, first the whole family would take the child to the Dharamsala (Gurdwara), perform Ardas, take Hukamnama of Maharaj, and make the child write the first letters of the alphabet ('Uura', 'Aira') with the hand of the Granthi Sahib on the wooden slate (*takhti*). He would distribute open Degh of Karah Parshad. Then the next day he would send the child to school.

Similarly, when by the age of ten or twelve the child had learned the Nitnem Gutkas or Panj Granthi, he would perform the ceremony of attaching the child to the feet of Sri Guru Granth Sahib Ji (reading/completion ceremony) and teach respect and service-maintenance of Maharaj. Then... make them perform Paath.

When his wife [Bib Harminder Kaur/Prob. Prem Kaur as per text later] passed away in 1922, he did not allow any weeping or wailing in his house. In the morning and evening, when women came for condolence, instead of [gossip/crying], he would make them sit and listen to Sukhmani Sahib path or Shabad...
