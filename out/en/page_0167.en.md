...Who can express the taste of your Kirtan?
...
Hearing the beautiful Shabad...
You turned [stone?] hearts into wax...
...

**Sriman Sant Sajjan Singh Ji Maghiane Wale,**
*'Khalsa Samachar', 30.8.1951*

25 years have passed since his (Bhai Hira Singh's) separation... remembering his relish-filled Kirtan...
...In the Kirtan of Singh Ji, that relish used to take the minds across...
...Hearing [his] Kirtan, the mind would become soft...

*"Hirai Ratan Man Sahje Samayi"* (The jewel of mind merges easily in the Divine Diamond)
*"Sagal Jot Inhi Ne Payi"* (They have obtained the entire Light)
*(Guru Granth Sahib Ang 483)*

**Gurpurab-dweller Bhai Hira Singh Ji**
*'Khalsa Samachar' 30-8-192?*
