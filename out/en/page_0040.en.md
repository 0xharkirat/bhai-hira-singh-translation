## English (Meaning Translation)

...[but on my insistence] I was administered Amrit there and then.
Since their business etc...

It was his effort that whichever good Giani or Preacher... he saw/knew, he would bring him to Diwans of Faruka, Sillanwali etc. and bless the Sangat by listening to Guru's praise.
**Sant Attar Singh Ji**, **Sant Gurbakhsh Singh Ji Sant Sangat Singh Ji**, **Bhai Sudh Singh Pradhan Singh Ji**, **Giani Thakur Singh Ji**, **Bhai Samund Singh Ji**... [used to come].
And Amrit Prachar used to take place and many souls used to take Amrit and become Tyar-Bar-Tyar.

In the Diwan of year **1914**, Bhai Sahib made this resolve that [all] relatives of his in-laws family who were Sehajdhari till now, this time all of them together should board the Guru's ship...
He requested Sant Attar Singh Ji and brought him, and such a color of preaching was bound that it is beyond description. Bhai Sahib's father-in-law **Bhai Duni Chand Ji** were five brothers. Further their sons and other relatives, about **40-45 gentlemen**, making all of them take Amrit together, they were adorned as Singhs.
When all the Singhs, adorned with beautiful turbans, Kachheras, Kirpans and saffron Kamarbands (waistbands), came out in the form of a procession singing "So Amrit Gur Te Paya...", a very captivating scene was created.

The mention of a child among these is noteworthy. This was **Arjan Das**, the younger son of **Bhai Khem Chand**, whose age was 12 years at that time. The elder son of Bhai Khem Chand (in relation he was the real uncle/Chacha of Bhai Hira Singh Ji's wife), **Bhai Khushal Singh**, had already taken Amrit and become a Singh on some earlier Diwan occasion. This time **Arjan Das** resolved to become a Singh and for this purpose started keeping hair (Kes) a month or two before the Diwan. When Bhai Khem Chand [came to know? or wife?], [she] used to stay on bed and she said, "If he takes Amrit, who will take care of his hair?"
Accordingly, she sent for **Lalu Barber** to home. But when Arjan came to know, he ran away from home barefoot and returned in the evening.
...remained hiding in the fields. There he kept chewing grains breaking the cobs of Chari (fodder crop).

## Notes
- Corrected likely OCR word: "ਲਾਲੂ ਨਾਂਈ" -> "Lalu Nai" (Barber name).
- Corrected likely OCR word: "ਚਰੀ" -> "Chari" (Fodder crop).
