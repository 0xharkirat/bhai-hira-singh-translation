## English (Meaning Translation)

That time was extremely blissful when along with Khalsa Ji, all Sindhis and Sanatanis were reciting behind the Ragi Singhs:
[Kirtan Lines]
...and dyed in the color of Unity were doing Simran of 'Ik Oankar'. In this Kirtan, a full wave of Gurmat preaching flowed and episodes were narrated showing Prema Bhakti (Loving Devotion) as superior to numerous rituals. While saying and telling all this, Bhai Sahib did not speak anything against any sect, elderly, Prophet or Rishi-Muni. He told everyone to walk on Truth, do honest labor and have heartfelt love for humanity.

Note: News of above Diwans are taken from reports sent by **S. Kartar Singh**, Asst. Secretary, Reception Committee Quetta, which [appeared] in issues of **August and September 1920**...

Such a flow of Kirtan ran that the **Lat Sahib (Governor)** of Balochistan held a Diwan in his own Kothi (Residence). The story of this, which my friend Late **Major Prem Singh Ji** (1902-1972) who was posted in Quetta at that time, wrote and sent is as follows:
"...The Agent to Governor General for Balochistan, whom common people used to call 'Lat', used to live in the Residency. There was always a strict guard at every gate of the House... This officer used to tour every बस्ती (settlement) on horse with a stick in hand. No one dared to go near this officer.
The Head Peon of the Residency was an elderly Sikh Sardar who looked very impressive in his royal red uniform and polished brass belt. His double turban, beautiful beard and red glowing face doubled his awe and he used to get his legitimate demands accepted by Lat Sahib with boldness.
One day after coming from Diwan, he thought why not have Parkash of Sri Guru Granth Sahib in Lat Sahib's Kothi and hold a Diwan with Bhai Hira Singh Ji's Kirtan. So he went to Lat Sahib and said, 'Huzoor, I have a request...'"

## Notes
- "Late Major Prem Singh Ji" is the source of the anecdote about the Head Peon arranging Kirtan at the Governor's house.
