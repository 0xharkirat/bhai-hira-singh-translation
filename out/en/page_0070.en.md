## English (Meaning Translation)

**Abbottabad (Hazara):**
In the **Hazara District** of Frontier Province (now Pakistan), **Abbottabad** is a prominent town and military cantonment. From here a road goes to Kashmir via **Muzaffarabad (Domel)** and another reaches **Murree** via Galiyan (hills). **Mansehra** and... are beautiful places from Abbottabad, whose sceneries are very captivating. Due to being a cold region, rich people used to spend summer months [here]. The Headquarter of British Government of Frontier Province also used to shift from Peshawar to **Nathia Gali** in summers. Many offices were in Abbottabad also. Due to this, there used to be lot of hustle-bustle in this area in summer months. Hundreds of officers, lawyers and other government employees, Babus etc. used to be there. Civilians also used to reach in large numbers. So there was a good opportunity for preaching here.

His lovers used to address him as 'Soami'. **'Radha'** was the name of his wife. That is why his successors named the sect **'Radha Soami'**.
**Baba Jaimal Singh**, the founder of **Beas** seat of Radha Soamis, was in Army service in those days. His platoon being in Agra, he used to go to **Gurdwara Mai Than**. Sri Shiv Dayal Singh used to perform **Katha of Gurbani** there first. Listening to Katha of Gurbani, he became his Satsangi.

Later Baba Jaimal Singh retired from Army service and in **1891** settled near village **Waraich** and **Ball Saran** on the bank of river Beas.
