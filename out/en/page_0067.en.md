## English (Meaning Translation)

...[Sikhi] was given up. In this way, slowly the Sikhi of Sindh kept falling.

**Preaching of Sikhi in Sindh from scratch:**
Fortunately, when **Sardar Sadhu Singh** of Forest Department, who was posted towards **Balochistan**, saw these conditions in the beginning of the twentieth century, he challenged **Chief Khalsa Diwan** for preaching in Sindh.
On this, Diwan started sending preaching Jathas from **1904**. In these Jathas **Sardar Sundar Singh Majithia**, **Sardar Harbans Singh Attari**, **Professor Jodh Singh** and **Bhai Hira Singh**...
**Bhai Bhag Singh Hira Singh Ji's Jatha** used to tour Sindh for about two months in winters every year and return after sounding the drum of Guru Nanak everywhere. In the Deras mentioned above, reaching every such place they would preach against the desecration of Gur-Dhams. This preaching put quite a halt [to bad practices] and reform happened in Deras.

Upon the publication of the above conditions about **Garhi Yasin**, a special Jatha was sent by the Diwan in **December 1909** in which **Professor Jodh Singh** and **Bhai Bhag Singh, Bhai Hira Singh Ji** were included. Hookah and Tobacco were stopped in the Dera and pledges were taken from Mahants for the future.

Although after some years Diwan's Jathas stopped going, **Bhai Bhag Singh Hira Singh Ji's Jatha** continued to tour for about two months every winter. The preaching of Sikhi done in these tours is hard to find a parallel. Thousands of people were made to quit Hookah, Tobacco, Alcohol and Charas. Sikh Gurdwaras were established and the lost faith in Sikhi was brought back. Hundreds of families took Amrit and became Tyar-Bar-Tyar Singhs.

**S. Tirath Singh Lalvani** from **Castophone** wrote in his letter of 13.12.1961 from **London**:
"[English Quote: ...Bhai Hira Singh's... contribution... great awakening...]"

In **1967**, the author had the good fortune of meeting **Diwan Parmanand Singh Ji Vakil** (1883-1971) when he had come to **Dagshai** to spend some summer days with his daughter **Bibi Nanki Ji**. Gurmukh Darshani Singh, stroking his white long beard said, "This gift was given to me by **Bhai Hira Singh Ji**." And with this he narrated the whole story of how he was a Parmanand who was very far from Sikhi Mandal and then how he became a Tyar-Bar-Tyar Singh and how now he is a lover of Naam Bani, waking at Amrit Vela and spending time in Simran...

## Notes
- "Castophone" - likely a company or organization name associated with S. Tirath Singh.
