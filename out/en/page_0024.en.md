## English (Meaning Translation)

...Asa Di Var [sung by them]... we obtained much benefit.

In the year 1926, Bhai Bhag Singh Ji suffered a heavy shock of the passing away of his beloved son **Bhai Hira Singh Ji**, but he accepted the Will of the Satguru and kept reciting Baani. For two-three years, he remained occupied in calming his mind while staying at a solitary place in his village Faruka.

In the year 1928, Bhai Bhag Singh Ji (at the age of 84 years) went to see **Sriman Bhai Sahib Bhai Vir Singh Ji** along with his younger [son]. Bhai Sahib ordered Bapu Ji: "Instead of Bhai Hira Singh Ji, form a Jatha with **Bhai Pradhan Singh** (youngest son) and engage in Panthic service." Bhai Bhag Singh Ji obeyed his order and forming a Jatha afresh, performed the service of Kirtan for about 6-7 years. On original Guru Nanak Dev Ji's birthday, in the Pandal of Chief Khalsa Diwan at Nankana Sahib...

**Nature and Character:**
Bhai Bhag Singh Ji's life was very simple, pure and clean. He did not hesitate to speak straight and true. Food was very simple and little - eating two rotis (bread) with one vegetable or dal. His health remained fine till the last breath. Up to the age of 95 years, he used to walk four-five miles easily. The vision of eyes remained intact till the end and he could read the Path of Sri Guru Granth Sahib and Gurmukhi newspaper easily without spectacles all his life.

Since he himself was firm in rhythm and beat (Sur-Taal), therefore he could not tolerate out-of-tune singing or out-of-beat sound. Whenever someone in the Jatha made such a mistake, he used to look with a stern eye.

There was ample element of humor in Bapu Ji. He used to [diffuse] a serious situation in a light manner. At the age of hundred years, it is a difficult task to consider life as life, but Bapu Ji used to smile in his last days just as in youth. The courage to live was present in him like young men. once I said, "Bapu Ji, if you cross one more year you will be fully hundred years old!" He replied with readiness, "So am I dying anytime soon?"
Once some women were talking, "Upon Bapu Ji's death we will make sweet rice and distribution (Parshad) etc." He was sleeping in the upper room (Chubara), he immediately spoke up, "First [let me die]..."
