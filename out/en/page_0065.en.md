## English (Meaning Translation)

...handing over [magnificent] buildings to Pakistan, the soul of the school crossed the border.
Roots of this plant were watered by the strength of **Bhai Hira Singh Ji's** faith and penance, that is why it could withstand such a huge earthquake [of Partition]. Satguru blessed and in **1949** it was re-established at **Ambala Cantt**. In a few years, the same old glory returned. Today this Ashram of Khalsa Panth is again in Chardi Kala (High Spirits).
The location of the school has changed, it has worn a new body, but in its tune is the same rhythm of Bhai Sahib. The reason for its existence and survival is the same - *"Vidiya Vichari Tan Parupkari"* (True learning leads to altruism).

It is our prayer that this garden of Guru Gobind Singh Ji always blooms like this. May this school never face any lack and the budding youth of our country receiving education in this holy institution, raising the slogan of *"Shubh Karman Te Kabhoon Na Taron"* (May I never shy away from good deeds), enter the society as Tyar-Bar-Tyar (Ready) Singhs.

**Present Condition of School:**
In this regard, in response to a query, some words from the letter dated **21.10.1976** of **Mian Sher Muhammad Kaliyar**, the present Head of Faruka [Pakistan] are as follows:
"Khalsa High School, its Boarding House and Dispensary's vast...
...and built such an institution in which children of poor and rich and every religion and caste are receiving education till today. With the education they get from here, they live their life walking on true and straight path. Although the founder of this school is not here, his holy memory is with us and will always remain. In these buildings we see the spirit of Bhai Hira Singh Ji..."
