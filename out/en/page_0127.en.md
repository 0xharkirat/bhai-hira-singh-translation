...[he would] respect everyone and wish well for everyone.
Despite performing Kirtan for hours and being tired, he would never just leave the Diwan; instead, after descending from the stage, he would sit down nearby to listen with full concentration to the Kirtan, Katha, or lecture of other scholars and performers, and would attend the Diwan until the Bhog (conclusion).

And saying this, his eyes filled with tears.

Then that Master gentleman came to the Gurdwara at night to listen to Kirtan, and came again the next morning too. Listening again and again, he would say, "Subhan Allah!
