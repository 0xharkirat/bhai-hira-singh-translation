## English (Meaning Translation)

...Convincing **Pyar Bai** (likely the name of the lady in previous page) to perform this task according to Gur-Maryada, invitation was given to Sikh Sangats of the area to join this Anand Karaj and give their cooperation. There was considerable opposition to this there and many gentlemen of the community [threatened] not to participate in the wedding...
This was the first Anand Karaj in that area which took place in **May 1900**.

This Anand Karaj had such a beautiful effect that on Bhai Sahib's appeal... many Gursikhs took a pledge to perform their children's weddings according to Gur-Maryada.
Among them first were **Bhai Amar Singh Ji Gandha**. The relationship of his granddaughter and daughter of **Bhai Lal Singh**, **Bibi Ranjit Kaur**, was fixed with **Bhai Harwand Singh**, nephew of a prominent and respected Sikh of the area **Bhai Nirmal Singh Tarkhana Wale**.
When the time of wedding came, a huge obstacle arose. Bhai Amar Singh Ji was a firm devout Singh, who used to wake up at Amrit Vela and recite Bani... [but the other side] was of [Sanatan?] views.
Bhai Hira Singh Ji made a firm resolve that taking the shelter of Guru, this task must be performed according to Gur-Maryada only. Because both these gentlemen were prominent and respected in the area, their doing so would clear the way for everyone in future. Therefore, staying in **Faruka** for full eighteen days, he preached Gurmat...
[Opponents insisted] it will be by Brahmanical method only. Many efforts were made till late night that the boy's family might agree, but they remained firm on their stubbornness. Finally Bhai Sahib... intervening got this decision made that only the boy (groom) should be taken and Lavan (marriage rounds) be performed, and let no Barati (wedding guest) join.

Kirtan started and Bhai Hira Singh Ji started the rain of Amrit Bani... listening to the explanation all Hindus and Muslims were left stunned. All started asking for forgiveness, saying "We didn't know that Guru's Maryada is like this..."
For future... the brotherhood pledged to perform Anand Karaj. This Anand Karaj took place on **27 August**...
After this, every Sikh boy and girl's wedding in that area [started happening according to Gur-Maryada].

## Notes
- "Tarkhana Wale" likely refers to the village name or sub-caste identification used in the area.
