## English (Meaning Translation)

**Akali Movement and Gurdwara Reform Movement:**
As a Panthic Servant and Preacher, it was inevitable for **Bhai Hira Singh Ji** to be affected by the Gurdwara Reform Movement, and he felt the responsibility on his head, which he experienced fully. Panthic pain and enthusiasm were overflowing inside him. The need to [liberate Gurdwaras?] was felt by Panthic leaders. For this purpose, Bhai Hira Singh Ji kept dedicating his service to the Panth.

**Birth of Akali Movement:**
In **1919**, when the butcher of Jallianwala Bagh **Dyer** was given a **Siropa** (Robe of Honor) by the Sarbrah (Manager) and Pujaris of Sri Darbar Sahib, the blood of Sikhs boiled.
Agitation started for Gurdwara Management Reform and moving forward this agitation gave birth to the **Akali Movement**.

First of all voice was raised against the apostate Sarbrah of **Gurdwara Babe Di Ber, Sialkot**, **Ganda Singh?** and forming a Gurdwara Committee, the management was given to the Panth.
[Mention of Khalsa Baradri/low caste Sikhs?] started administering Amrit to untouchable castes and decorating them as Singhs and Khalsa Baradri Singhs in form of a procession reached Sri Darbar Sahib on **12 October 1920**.
After some dispute it was decided to take Hukamnama (Order) of Sri Darbar Sahib (Guru Granth Sahib). So this Hukam came:
*"Niguhre Ka Hai Nao Burra, Niguhra Hoe Na Koi ||"*
(The name of one without a Guru is bad, may no one be without a Guru.)
(Guru Granth Sahib, Ang 636 - *Correction: Text says 638, Quote says 'Nigure Ka Hai Nau Bura', actually 'Sorath Mahala 3... Nigure Ka Hai Nau Bura' is Ang 636/637? The text quotes 'Gunviheen Bharam Apradhi Bhai...' which is Sorath M:3 Ang 638*).
*Correction reading Text Hukam:*
*"Gunviheen Bharam Apradhi Bhai, Poorai Satgur Layi Palaye || Rahao ||"*
(I am without virtue, wandering in doubt and a sinner, O brother; the Perfect True Guru has taken me into His care/hem. Pause.)
(Guru Granth Sahib, Ang 638)

Hearing this Hukam, Pujaris ran away leaving Akal Takht empty and management came to the Panth. On this a committee of **9 gentlemen** was formed for management of Sri Darbar Sahib. Then on **13 November 1920**, **36 men** Gurdwara Parbandhak [Committee formed].
[On 15-16] November 1920, in a great Panthic gathering at Sri Akal Takht, **Shiromani [Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee]** of **175 members** [was formed].

## Notes
- The text describes the pivotal moment when control of the Golden Temple shifted from British-appointed Mahants to the Sikh community (SGPC). The Hukamnama cited (Ang 638) was interpreted as Guru accepting the "sinners/low castes" into his fold.
