## English (Meaning Translation)

[...He used to follow the maxim that] 'When you live by being detached [you can keep others happy]. [If you yourself] get fed up with life, then by doing so you cannot keep others happy.' He used to remain happy himself and [gave happiness] to others.

**Last Time and Departure for Guru's Abode:**
In the year 1936-37, when Bapu Ji was about 93 [years old], he stopped going on [long] tours. But... he continued the service of Kirtan in the Dharamsala of [his] village till quite late age. The Satguru had bestowed such physical strength that he used to do his personal chores, bathing etc. himself till the last time. Going out to the fields/jungle (for nature's call) and walking according to need [was routine].

In **February-March 1947**, he felt himself a bit unwell. At that time his second son **Bhai Gurmukh Singh Ji** Giani, who was employed as Religious and Punjabi teacher at Chiefs College Lahore, took him from Faruka to Lahore for service and treatment.
And here on **23 April 1947**, after living an age of about **103 years**, he departed for the Guru's Abode.
