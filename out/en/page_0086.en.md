## English (Meaning Translation)

'...I bow a thousand times. You are fearless and steady [to go to] your Kalgidhar Father...'
...
*Muh Marne Ka Chao Hai Marau Ta Har Kai Duar ||*
*Mat Har Puchhai Kaun Hai Para Hamarai Bar ||*
(I have a longing to die; if I die, let it be at God's Door. Lest God asks, 'Who is this lying at My Door?')
(Guru Granth Sahib, Ang 1367)

...[Satguru], who saved the honor of a devotee who stood guard at a prostitute's door all night to save his friend from falling, why will He not help you brave warriors who save Dharma, Nation and Country? You belong to Dashmesh Ji and He is your protector forever. My worshipable Gursikhs! Come, see with my eyes! He (Guru Gobind Singh) is standing in the heavens, with Quoit (Chakar) on head, Kirpan in Gatra, and gesturing with his long arm reaching up to knees towards you...

*Inhi Ki Kirpa Ke Saje Hum Hain*
*Nahi Mo So Garib Kror Pare ||*
(It is by their grace that I am adorned, otherwise there are millions of poor people like me.)

Not only the 500 Singhs of Shahidi Jatha, but eyes of thousands of Sikh Sangat became tearful. To the extent that police constables, Thanedar and their Police Officer of CID also wiped their [tears?].
Jatha departed and thousands of Sangat walked in escort of the Jatha till **Sri Tarn Taran**.

This Police Officer was a resident of village **Gulyana**, Tehsil **Gujarkhan**, District **Rawalpindi**. He was a **Muyal Brahmin** by caste. Sikh leaders thought that Bhai Hira Singh Ji had encouraged the Jatha to become martyrs...
But confronting such lions... Government will lose its awe and finally it will be difficult for Government to defeat these living martyrs who keep their life on their palm...
When Governor realized this reality, Government changed its policy and instead of firing bullets, the series of arrests started and finally...

## Notes
- The power of Bhai Hira Singh Ji's speech is described, moving even the police to tears.
- The shift in British policy from shooting to arresting (due to the moral force of Akalis) is noted.
