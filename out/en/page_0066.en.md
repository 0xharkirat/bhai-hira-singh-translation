## English (Meaning Translation)

**How Sikhi reached Sindh and why it declined:**
There is no doubt that in difficult and tough times of the Panth, Saints and Mahants of **Udasi Samparda** kept Sikhi alive and maintained the service of Sikh Gurdwaras and shrines. Wherever Udasis went, they gave sermon of Sikh religion to the locals and by installing **Sri Guru Granth Sahib**, established a source of Gurmat preaching.

In Sindh also, Udasis established many Deras and preached Sikhi. Then Khalsas took this preaching forward, as a result of which thousands of Sehajdhari loving Sikhs were created in Sindh and they made their sons keep Kesh.
But then such a time came that due to lack of preaching, Sikhi in Sindh became loose/diluted. There was no such organization of Khalsa which could keep the chain of preaching running.
The result was that the servitors of those very Gur-Asthans started falling from Sikhi. They started taking waves of Charas, Tobacco and Cannabis (Bhang).

In the issue of **Khalsa Samachar dated 12 August 1908**, it is mentioned that once at **Garhi Yasin**, at **Baba Ganga Ram's** place, when some Singhs went for Darshan, ahead Rababis were performing Kirtan but alongside many people were unhesitatingly smoking Hookahs. Upon asking of those Singhs, Hookahs were stopped. But in Sindh it had become a common custom that tobacco was smoked in Gur-Asthans. The only lack remaining was that Hookah had not reached inside the room of Guru Granth Sahib.

Then Yogis, Bairagis and Sanyasis caused even more damage. These people themselves smoked tobacco and were clean-shaven (Rund-Mund). Seeing the Sikh faith in Sindh, these people installed Guru Granth Sahib in their Deras but along with it placed idols of their deities. In this way started misleading Sikhs away from Sikhi. In Sindh, Sadhus had great respect, whichever garb they belonged to. All men and women blindly followed these Sadhus...
So slowly reading Gurmukhi was abandoned. Then whatever word of Guru Granth Sahib they used to hear in morning was abandoned...
Condition became so pathetic that **Keshadhari Sikhs**, instead of Dastar (Turban), used to keep a Pagri-like Topi (Cap) on their head... and Dhoti on loin...

## Notes
- "Rund-Mund" refers to shaven heads/faces.
- "Garhi Yasin" is a town in Sindh (now Pakistan).
